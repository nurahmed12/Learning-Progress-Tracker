Draw Border Grid can help us easily draw a border around any range of cells

- Alignment, Wrap Text, Merge & Center:

Go to Paper Layout -> Page Setup -> Paper Size and choose appropriate paper size such as A4
Align your cell elements using the Home -> Alignment and choosing either of the given alignment
From Home, click the Orientation right above the Alignment and choose alignments such as Angle Clockwise or Angle Counterclockwise
On the left side of the Orientation, the Indents can be found. We can use it to move the elements inside the cell left or right little by little
On the Alignment section, we can also find the Merge & Align section, we  can use it to merge multiple cells
We can also use Increase Intends and Decrease Indent on merge cells, and based on the merge, they behave differently
You can also insert pictures of any size and resize into cells, you can also align pictures into anywhere inside the cell, you can even remove Background of the image 😱
If you want to keep the Cell Size and also fit texts inside the cell, then click Wrap Text in the Alignment section
You can set Margins to adjust the contents inside the page, go to Page Layout then Page Setup and adjust Margins

- Currency, Accounting, Currency VS Accounting:

From Home -> Number you can select Currency or Accounting format by changing General

We can also change Currency symbol to other Symbols like Taka
We can also set custom symbols such as TK instead of symbol from Right Click -> Format Cells -> Custom and then type 0.00 TK or 0.00 "TK"

- Short Date, Long Date, Date, Time, Date & Time:

If we insert a date into a cell and if it is left aligned, then the date format is not correct
If the date format is showing MM/DD/YY then we can fix it by opening Control Panel and then clicking Clock and Region then changing the format. This will automatically change the Excel date format too
Selecting one cell then clicking Ctrl + ; will automatically insert the current date in short form in the cell
In order to add time along with date in Date, we can use Ctrl + ; + Space + Ctrl + Shift + ;

- Percentage, Fraction, Scientific, Original Number:

We can change value type into Percentage in many ways such as from General, Clicking Format Cells, Clicking at the top most of a column and then Right Click then Format Cells etc
If we select Fraction type, then inserting any decimal value will automatically convert into Fraction
If more than one values of fraction (233/523) is not shown, then we can go to Format Cells and then select Up To Three Digits

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Highlight Cells Rules):

Select cells and press Conditional Formatting then Highlight Cells Rules and then choosing any of the operations and then set a value or select a cell containing value to show insights
To change the color of a condition, go to Select Color and then Custom then Fill
We can access More rules like Greater Than or Equals To from Conditional Formatting -> Highlight Cells -> More Rules
Blanks mean if there is any missing values or not

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Top and Botton Rules):

Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow from one cell will automatically select an entire column
We can easily sort an entire column using the Sort & Filter in Home menu on the right side of Auto Sum

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Data Bars & Color Scales):

In order to insert an entire row or rows, we have to click the most left row number, then right click and insert. We can pull the black dot to select more rows, and then inserting will add more rows as well. Same goes for column
We can use Data Bars to represent sum or other calculated values in a bar form, We can remove digits and only show bars, in order to do it we need to select the bars area then go to Conditional Formatting -> More Rules -> Edit Rules -> Only Bars
Different Color Scales represent different values, you can either choose red to indicate extreme value and green as normal value, or you can do the opposite
We can go to Conditional Formatting -> Manage Rules and modify rules as needed
We can also Change the range for which the color will change, for that we need to change the Type from Manage Rules -> Edit Rules into Number, then we can set values
We can do the same for Percent
We can also use Formula like =average(A1:A9)
Percent means “out of 100.”
→ Example: 75% = 75 out of 100.
Percentile tells you the position in a dataset.
→ Example: 75th percentile = you scored better than 75% of the group.
Percent = value
Percentile = rank

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Icon Sets, and New Rules):

Double cliking selected cells' + icon will automatically copy an entire column instead of just seleting an entire column manually by dragging the + icon to the bottom or top
We can select multiple rows or columns by pressing Ctrl + left click
We can change values for which the icons will be shown from Conditional Formatting -> Manage Rules -> Edit Rules and then changing Percent to Number, we can also change condition from <= to <
Select and entire table, then go to Conditional Formatting -> New Rule then press -> Use formula to determine which cell to format ten press = and select a cell that you want to use to find all information about that cells' row, then It would show something like this =$E$9, remove $ from 9 so that the column is locked but all rows are unlocked ($ unlocks rows or columns), after that click = and click a cell outside of the table, then click format and fill a color, after that if you type any item (of the column that you used to find its' row information) in that cell outside of the table it will color the row corrosponding to that value
We can also make a rule so that whenever any text value is inserted into a cell where a number should have been placed, then the cell or eells will change color, for that we need to select a cell and go to New Rule -> Use formula to determine which cell to format then click = and type istext() and select any cell that you want to check whther it is text or not and remove the $ from both row and column and then Fill with appropriate color, after applying that use format printer to apply same rules to other cells that you want this rule to be applied on, then if any of the selected cell has text then the color of that cel will change
We can type =istext() or =isnmber() and then click a cell to show TRUE or FAlSE in any other cell
