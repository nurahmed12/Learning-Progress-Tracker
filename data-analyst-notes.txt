Minimize and Maximize Formula Bar
Hiding and Unhiding Heading, Formula Bar, Gridlines from View Menu
Name box, where cell number is shown
Calculating manually by placing = and then clicking which cells are we trying to add, subtract, multiply, divide. e.g., =B2*C2
How to pull cells to automatically calculate rest of the values after calculating one
We can also perform Boolean operations or comparisons. e.g., =B2=B3 FALSE, =B2<B3 TRUE
Selecting the entire sheet by clicking the arrow at the top left corner of the sheet
Ctrl + Navigation button (up, left, bottom, right) takes us to the end of the sheet
Centering values in the cell through Home -> Alignment 
Vertical and Horizontal Scroll
Create multiple Sheets and navigating to them
Zoom in Zoom out, Font Size, Style etc etc
Status bar (Bottom left) shows Ready (ready to work), Enter (pressing enter will complete)

Creating new files, Saving files, Opening files manually and with Keyboard Shortcut (Ctrl + N, Ctrl + S, Ctrl + O)
Print the excel file

- Introduction (Cut, Copy, Paste, Format Painter, Clear All):

Copy, Cut, Paste using buttons from Home and using shortcuts (Ctrl + x | c | v)
After changing font or style or color of a cell element, we can select that cell and click Format Printer and then drag other cells to apply same font or style or color to them as well
When we copy or cut something then the Clipboard contains that value, we can simply take it use it later, we can click Paste All to paste all Clipboard elements at once

- Basic Navigation: 
Ribbons (The navigations on the top, can be hidden using Ctrl + F1)
Cells (Where we insert data)
Range (Selected cells area. e.g., A1:D1 (Horizontal), A1:A5 (Vertical), A1:D5 (Multiple selection))
Worksheets (Tabs of sheets of excel. e.g., | Sheet1 | Sheet2 | )

- Font Group (All Options):

Double clicking a column edge will automatically adjust it's size to show full texts, based on the elements it contains
Font size increase and decrease
Different Fonts and styles (Ctrl + B makes texts bold, same goes to Ctrl + U | I)
Click arrow beside Underline to choose Double Underline
Font and Cell Color change
Phone number's first 0 is not shown, so we start with ' and then type number to show the leading 0, but it will be considered String
Select a cell and press Del from keyboard to delete that cell element
Choosing Borders for a group of cells
When a cell contains number and it is resized to small, the number will be shown as Complex Number
Home -> Font -> Strikethrough then the text or number of the selected cell will be crossed in the middle
For Superscript or Subscript, select the value that will go up, then click Superscript or Superscript from Font box arrow
If dragging a cell doesn't give you a series of sequential elements, then click Fill Series
If date is not increasing like you want, try different sequence until it automatically makes the cell into date format
Use Paste Special to copy column and paste it as row
Draw Border Grid can help us easily draw a border around any range of cells

- Alignment, Wrap Text, Merge & Center:

Go to Paper Layout -> Page Setup -> Paper Size and choose appropriate paper size such as A4
Align your cell elements using the Home -> Alignment and choosing either of the given alignment
From Home, click the Orientation right above the Alignment and choose alignments such as Angle Clockwise or Angle Counterclockwise
On the left side of the Orientation, the Indents can be found. We can use it to move the elements inside the cell left or right little by little
On the Alignment section, we can also find the Merge & Align section, we  can use it to merge multiple cells
We can also use Increase Intends and Decrease Indent on merge cells, and based on the merge, they behave differently
You can also insert pictures of any size and resize into cells, you can also align pictures into anywhere inside the cell, you can even remove Background of the image 😱
If you want to keep the Cell Size and also fit texts inside the cell, then click Wrap Text in the Alignment section
You can set Margins to adjust the contents inside the page, go to Page Layout then Page Setup and adjust Margins

- Currency, Accounting, Currency VS Accounting:

From Home -> Number you can select Currency or Accounting format by changing General
By default the currency and Accounting is formatted as USD, but you can change it to other currencies
To remove the USD dollar sign, we can right click on the selected cell or cells, then go to Format Cells, and change the format to None
In Currency format, the -100 is represented as -100 but in Accounting format, -100 is represented as (100)
In Currency, 0 is represented as 0.00 and in Accounting, 0 is represented as -
We can also change Currency symbol to other Symbols like Taka
We can also set custom symbols such as TK instead of symbol from Right Click -> Format Cells -> Custom and then type 0.00 TK or 0.00 "TK"

- Short Date, Long Date, Date, Time, Date & Time:

If we insert a date into a cell and if it is left aligned, then the date format is not correct
If the date format is showing MM/DD/YY then we can fix it by opening Control Panel and then clicking Clock and Region then changing the format. This will automatically change the Excel date format too
Selecting one cell then clicking Ctrl + ; will automatically insert the current date in short form in the cell
In order to add time along with date in Date, we can use Ctrl + ; , Space , Ctrl + Shift + ;

- Percentage, Fraction, Scientific, Original Number:

We can change value type into Percentage in many ways such as from General, Clicking Format Cells, Clicking at the top most of a column and then Right Click then Format Cells etc
If we select Fraction type, then inserting any decimal value will automatically convert into Fraction
If more than one values of fraction (233/523) is not shown, then we can go to Format Cells and then select Up To Three Digits

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Highlight Cells Rules):

Select cells and press Conditional Formatting then Highlight Cells Rules and then choosing any of the operations and then set a value or select a cell containing value to show insights
To change the color of a condition, go to Select Color and then Custom then Fill
We can access More rules like Greater Than or Equals To from Conditional Formatting -> Highlight Cells -> More Rules
Blanks mean if there is any missing values or not

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Top and Botton Rules):

Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow from one cell will automatically select an entire column
We can easily sort an entire column using the Sort & Filter in Home menu on the right side of Auto Sum

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Data Bars & Color Scales):

In order to insert an entire row or rows, we have to click the most left row number, then right click and insert. We can pull the black dot to select more rows, and then inserting will add more rows as well. Same goes for column
We can use Data Bars to represent sum or other calculated values in a bar form, We can remove digits and only show bars, in order to do it we need to select the bars area then go to Conditional Formatting -> More Rules -> Edit Rules -> Only Bars
Different Color Scales represent different values, you can either choose red to indicate extreme value and green as normal value, or you can do the opposite
We can go to Conditional Formatting -> Manage Rules and modify rules as needed
We can also Change the range for which the color will change, for that we need to change the Type from Manage Rules -> Edit Rules into Number, then we can set values
We can do the same for Percent
We can also use Formula like =average(A1:A9)
Percent means “out of 100.”
→ Example: 75% = 75 out of 100.
Percentile tells you the position in a dataset.
→ Example: 75th percentile = you scored better than 75% of the group.
Percent = value
Percentile = rank

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Icon Sets, and New Rules):

Double cliking selected cells' + icon will automatically copy an entire column instead of just seleting an entire column manually by dragging the + icon to the bottom or top
We can select multiple rows or columns by pressing Ctrl + left click
We can change values for which the icons will be shown from Conditional Formatting -> Manage Rules -> Edit Rules and then changing Percent to Number, we can also change condition from <= to <
Select and entire table, then go to Conditional Formatting -> New Rule then press -> Use formula to determine which cell to format ten press = and select a cell that you want to use to find all information about that cells' row, then It would show something like this =$E$9, remove $ from 9 so that the column is locked but all rows are unlocked ($ unlocks rows or columns), after that click = and click a cell outside of the table, then click format and fill a color, after that if you type any item (of the column that you used to find its' row information) in that cell outside of the table it will color the row corrosponding to that value
We can also make a rule so that whenever any text value is inserted into a cell where a number should have been placed, then the cell or eells will change color, for that we need to select a cell and go to New Rule -> Use formula to determine which cell to format then click = and type istext() and select any cell that you want to check whther it is text or not and remove the $ from both row and column and then Fill with appropriate color, after applying that use format printer to apply same rules to other cells that you want this rule to be applied on, then if any of the selected cell has text then the color of that cel will change
We can type =istext() or =isnmber() and then click a cell to show TRUE or FAlSE in any other cell

- Styles Group (Format as Table):

Clicking the bottom right most cell of a table and ten pressing Tab from keyboard will automatically insert a row at the bottom
In order to get sum value of all rows in the last column, we have to select the last column, and then press Alt + = and the column will turn into Sum or Total Column
We can access many functionalities such as Filter from each column header down arrow
We can use Select All from filter to show everything and unckeck parts that we don't want to see
Ctrl + T will automatically convert the selected area as table

- Styles Group (Cells Styles):

We can modify a Cell Style by right cliking on the style and then click on Modify
In order to get commas within big numbers, we can select cells and then go to Cell Styles and click Commas right below the Number section
Comma[0] means there will be no decimal values
We can make a custom style by clicking New Cell Style -> Format -> Custom then choosing #,##0 and typing #,##0 "/-" then ok, after that Style 2 will be created, we can choose style 2 to see the results
Merge Styles is used to bring one worksheet styles into another

- Cells Group (Insert and Delete):
 
Insert Sheet Rows/Columns will add an entire row or column
Insert Sheet is used to add Sheets and same goes for the Delete Sheet

- Cells Group (Format Option):

You can manually Fit Columns or Rows according to their elements by selecting the area, then Cells -> Format -> AutoFit Row Hight or AutoFit Column Width
Or you can use shortcut such as Ctrl + A to select everything, then Alt + H O A for Row Hight, and Alt + H O I for Column Width
Or we can set size of rows hight and column width by clicking Cells -> Format -> Row Hight or Column Width
We can also Hide, Unhide Columns or Rows
We can select a a specific area of a sheet by clicking one Cell of that area and then Ctrl + A, This will only select the area instead of the entire sheet
We can rename sheets and change their order
Locked cells prevent editing when the sheet is protected.
Cells are locked by default so you can choose what to protect when applying Sheet Protection.
Lock only works after enabling Review > Protect Sheet or Cells > Format > Protect Sheet
Built a project using if and Lock feature

- Formulas & Functions (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, MAX, ROUND, and More Functions):

We can find sum multiple ways like selecting an area will show sum at the bottom most of the sheet, Another way is using AutoSum, then we can also use formula such as =SUM(E8:f4)
We can swap Columns or Rows by pressing Ctrl + X on the selected Row or Column, then click on the first cell of the place where you want to place the current Row or Column and then press Ctrl + Shift + =
ROUND(Cell or Value, number of digits) 
ROUND(E11, 0) Means non decimal round, Rounds to the nearest whole number, e.g., 10.3 > 10 and 10.7 > 11, if 10.5 > 11
ROUND(E11, 1 or any positive number) Means decimal round, Rounds the (1 or any positive number)th value to it's nearest whole number, e.g., ROUND(7.445, 1) > 7.4, ROUND(7.445) > 7.45
ROUND(E11, -1 or any negative number) Means tens, hundreds or more round, Rounds the (1 or any negative number) + 1th number from right most to it's nearest whole number based on the (1 or any negative number)th number, e.g., ROUND(123412, -1) > 123410, ROUND(123416, -1) > 123420, ROUND(123415, -2) > 123400
ROUNDUP(E11, 0 or Positive or Negative) Similar to ROUND() function but it only rounds to the next whole number, e.g., ROUNDUP(5.1, 0) > 6
ROUNDDOWN(E11, 0 or Positive or Negative) Opposite of ROUNDUP()
MROUND(E11, multiple) Rounds to the nearest Multiple, e.g., MROUND(12311, 4) > 12312 Means 12312 is the nearest to 12311 which can be devided by 4

- Fill Option (Up, Down, Left, Right, Across Worksheet):

Fill option has multiple elements such as Up, Down, Left Right (Ctrl + U or D or L or R), we use it to copy and paste a cell content to the selected area of cells
We can alternatively use the Auto Fill Options icon that appears after we select a series of cells, we can change it to Copy Cells
In order to access Across Worksheets, we need to select an area then while holding Ctrl we need to click the Sheet we want to use as destinition, then the Across Worksheet will be active, then we need to click Across Worksheet and we will find options such as All, Contents, Format, we can choose either of them to copy paste items across worksheets

- Fill Option (Fill Series and Justify):

If you have one cell containing a number and you want to create a series then choose an area Rowwise or Columnwise then go to Fill > Series then choose either Rows or Columns based on your need and then set a number range if desired and press ok
Alternatively you can use shortcut Alt + E + I + S then Enter
If you want to move a column or row to another place without using copy paste, then Select the Column or Row, then Hover the mouse until a Move icon shows up, then Click while Holding Shift and move it to whereever needed
Linear increases additionally, Growth increases multiplically, WorkDay means all the Working Days excluding the Off Days, 
Normal Fill = repeats or continues a simple pattern
Trend Fill = fits a mathematical trend line (more intelligent)
When we have a big sentence that does not fit into a cell by default then we can use Justify to break that sentence into words and insert those words below cells one by one, It will break the sentence based on the Cell size

- Clear Option (Clear All, Clear Formats, Clear Contents, Clear Comments):

We can add comments on cells by right clicking on a cell and pressing Insert Comment
We can also reshape the Comment Box, Hide, Unhide it
Clear Formats/Contents/Comments/Hyperlinks removes specific part of the selected area but Clear All removes everything
Clear Hyperlinks removes only hyperlinks while Remove Hyperlinks removes both hyperlinks and formatting (underline, blue color)

- Editing Group (Sorting):

In order to generate random series you can use the formula =ROUND(Value1, (Value2 - Value1) * RAND(), 2) , this will generate random numbers between Value1 and Value2
1. RAND()
Returns a random decimal number between 0 and 1.
Example output: 0.2438, 0.8793, etc.
2. (b - a)
This is the range or width of the interval.
For example, if a = 5 and b = 10, then (b - a) = 5.
3. (b - a) * RAND()
Scales the random number into your desired range.
Now you get a random decimal between 0 and (b - a).
Example: If RAND() = 0.3, and (b - a) = 5, then this part is 1.5.
4. a + ...
This shifts the number up to start at a.
So you now get a number between a and b.
Example: a = 5, so 5 + 1.5 = 6.5
5. ROUND(..., 2)
Rounds the final result to 2 decimal places.
We can also use =RANDBETWEEN(Value1, Value2), it will generate random numbers between Value1 and Value2
We can also sort color wise, for that, go to Sort & Filter > Custom Sort and select Sort on to Color, then we can choose Order color and Ascending or Descending, after that we can Add Level and order the color based on our need
We can use the Up and Down buttons to move a selected Cell upward or downward
We can also do the same for Cell Icons
We can customize the order by selecting Custom List and listing the values as we desire
We can also save the custom order by clicking the Add button
We can sort multiple columns by selecting them and then choosing Custom sort and adding levels for each column
If we select an area where a blank cell exists, then sorting will place that blank cell at the most bottom
We can select a single cell of a column and click sort and the entire column will be sorted
If we want to sort a single column of an area where all the columns are connected, then an warning messege will pop and give us two options, where if we choose Expand the selection then the entire area will change with the sort, but If we choose Continue with current selection then the connection will not be represented properly
Selecting an entire area and then custom sorting only one column will change others accordingly

- Editing Group (Custom Sort):

If our columns are not placed sequentially like Name ID Income Age, then we can custom sort it and fix their positions, in order to do that we need to mark 1 to n (number of columns) to each column based on which position what column should be in ascending order, we should mark each cell by placing 1 to n on their immidiate above cell, then we should select the area with those marked cells above, after that we click Custom sort > Options > Sort left to right, and then we should select Sort by as the initial row number
We can do the same thing for Top to bottom

- Editing Group (Filter):

Ctrl + Shift + L turn Auto Filters to selected area, you may see dropdown icon appear, but that does not mean that the area is converted into a table, it shows up because of AutoFilters, in order to convert a selected area into table, use Ctrl + T
AND = Both condition must be true
OR = Either one can be true or both
Once we apply filter to a selected area and then make any change in any cell or rows of the selected cell, then the Reapply option becomes accessible, by clicking Reapply button, we can reapply all the filters to the changed cells or rows and the cells or rows of the selected area will change 

- Editing Group (Find & Replace):

Ctrl + F is the shortcut for Find and Replace
From Options << we can find Match case, which will only show targets that matches exactly, and becomes case sensitive
Match entire cell contents will only show targets that matches only search portion, cells containing additional contents will not be shown, it is not case sensitive
If we select Within Workbook, then all targets accross all sheets will be shown
By rows mean the search will show next results row by row if the target is present in the same row, and then to the next column
By columns mean the opposite
If we select Lock in as Comments, and write something for example Good Boy in the Find what box, then the result will show all comments containing Good Boy
Ctrl + H will redirect you to the Find and Replace > Replace 
If we want to replace formats accross cells then, click Format box of Find what and select Choose format from cells and click which cell you want as target, then click the Format box of Replace with, then you can either manually select a format or you can Choose format from other cells

- Editing Group (Find & Select (Go to & Go to Special)):

Ctrl + G is the shortcut for Go To section
Fn + F5 is an alternative shortcut
Go to is used to go to any specific cell
Constants mean cells that does not have any formula, or general data
=CONCATENATE(E11, " ", D11) is used to concatenate two strings and create a new strings, in this case cell E11 and D11 are combined with a space " " to create a new string
Current region will select an area if the current selected cell belongs to one area, if not, then only the cell will be shown
Array is used to perform calculations with multiple cells at once, in traditional ways we apply a formula and drag down the formula to generate other results with same formula, but in array, when we apply a formula, it automatically applies the formula to other selected cells as well
regular formulas as scalar operations: they take one (or a few) inputs and give you one output in a single cell. An array formula lets you work with whole sets of inputs at once, and — depending on the function — can return multiple outputs (spill into many cells) or feed a multi‑step calculation in one shot.
In order to use array, we must use Ctrl + Shift + Enter in a cell to activate array to that cell
e.g., We cannot do this normally =AVERAGE(C30:C45 - D30:D45), but by clicking Ctrl + Shift + Enter we can make it array and do this task
WordArt, images, shapes, emojis are Objects
Row difference and Column difference show non similar or unequal values within an area row by row or column by column
Precedents and Dependents are like Independent and Dependent variables, Independents are those which leads to a calculation of other value, while dependents are the result that is derived from independents
Ctrl + [ is the shortcut to find Precedent
We can show tracking of Precedents by clicking Formulas > Trace precedents, then an arrow will show navigation fo how the precedents leads to a result
Ctrl + ] is the shortcut for showing dependents
Precedent -> What cells affect the value of the current or selected cell
Dependent -> What cells are affected by the value of the current or selected cell
If we select an entire column by clicking at the top and then press Ctrl + Shift + -> or <- then all of the cells including the selected column's cells will be selected in arrow's direction, then we can fill them with white color to make the cells disappear
We can do the same with row by selecting a row as well
Ctrl + end will take you to the last cell 
Ctrl + home will take you to the first cell 
If we hide some rows or columns and then copy the area and paste it in other sheets or files, then the hidden cells will also be pasted, in order to prevent that after we hide some cells or rows or columns, then we select the area and Go to special > Visible cells only then copy the area and paste it somewhere else, then the hidden cells will not be pasted
We can use the shortcut Alt + ; to select Visible cells only
Conditional formatting shows us where in the entire file Conditional formatting is applied

- Data Validation (Any value and Whole number):

If we choose a data validation from Data > Data Validation which is in the Data Tools section, then change Allow from Any value to other such as Whole number then the selected cells will only allow you to fill whole numbers only, if you try anything else, it will show an error
We can also custom set an input message from Data > Data Validation > Input Message to show when the user is entering an input
The input message pop up box can be dragged to some other place if bothering
We can also select the Error Alert from Data > Data Validation > Style as Stop (Does not allow the user to continue), Warning (The user is shown a warning message but still can continue), Information (Similar to warning message)
If we choose either Information or Warning and enter an invalid data then we can spot them by clicking Data Validation > Circle Invalid Data and all the invalid data will be circled
We can clear the circles by clicking Data Validation > Clear Validation Circles
After writing something in a cell and presseing Enter will move to the bottom cell, but pressing Shift + Enter will move to the above cell
Instead of manually typing values in cells, we can use Dropdown list that adds a dropdown arrow attached to cells from which we can select pre defined values
In order to do that we need to select the area then Data Validation, then select List in Allow section, and type which options or values you want to show in the list in source section
We can also do another thing, we can list whichever contents that we want to use in the list in somewhere in the sheet, and instead of typing the options or values in the Source section we can select those cells where the elements are 
If you add a new option or value in that reference list, then the value will not be shown in the dropdown, so you have to move the new option or value using Shift + Drag to the middle of that list
We can also change order by moving or replacing cells within the reference list
We can also use reference list from other sheets as well
Text length means what will be the length of the text that we will put in every cell, suppose we write Hello in a cell, so if we set the text length to 5 then it will allow hello to be inserted, but if we add one more letter then it will show error, Note that space is also counted as letter
For allowing only unique values remember this:
1. Formula Pattern
   =COUNTIF(<lookup_range>, <this_cell>) = 1
   • Returns TRUE if the value in <this_cell> appears exactly once in <lookup_range>.

2. Locking the Lookup Range
   • Fixed block (e.g. rows 10–17 in column K):
     =COUNTIF($K$10:$K$17, K10)=1
     – $K$10:$K$17 stays the same when you copy down.
     – K10 (no $) changes to K11, K12, etc.

   • Entire column:
     =COUNTIF($K:$K, K10)=1
     – $K:$K always means the whole column K.
     – Good for growing lists; slower on very large sheets; counts blanks too.

3. Criterion Cell Reference
   • Relative row (K10): adjusts to each row.
   • Absolute row ($K$10): always tests cell K10.

4. “$” Cheat‑Sheet
   • $ before column (e.g. $K) locks column.
   • $ before row (e.g. K$10) locks row.
   • $K$10 locks both column and row (single cell).
   • $K:$K locks entire column K.
   • $K$10:$K$17 locks that exact block.

CountIF function:

Quick Guide to COUNTIF in Excel

1. Function Structure  
   COUNTIF(range, criteria)  
   • Counts how many cells in range meet the given criteria.

2. Parameters  
   • range: the block of cells to check (e.g. A1:A100, K:K)  
   • criteria: condition each cell is tested against (number, expression, text, wildcard, or cell reference)

3. Types of Criteria  
   • Number  
     – COUNTIF(A1:A10, 5)  
       Counts cells exactly equal to 5.  
   • Expression (comparison)  
     – COUNTIF(B1:B20, “>100”)  
       Counts cells with values greater than 100.  
     – Operators: =, <>, >, <, >=, <= (always in quotes)  
   • Text  
     – COUNTIF(C1:C50, “Apple”)  
       Counts cells exactly matching “Apple” (case‑insensitive).  
   • Wildcards  
     – `*` matches any sequence of characters  
       • COUNTIF(NameRange, "East*") finds “East”, “Eastern Campus”, etc.  
       • COUNTIF(NameRange, "*son") finds “Johnson”, “Anderson”, etc.  
     – `?` matches exactly one character  
       • COUNTIF(CodeRange, "A?3") finds “AB3”, “A63” but not “A123”.  
       • COUNTIF(WordRange, "?at") finds “Cat”, “Bat” but not “That”.  
   • Cell reference  
     – COUNTIF(F1:F50, G1)  
       Counts cells equal to the value in G1.  
   • Expression with reference  
     – COUNTIF(F1:F50, “>” & G1)  
       Counts cells greater than the value in G1.  
   • Dates  
     – COUNTIF(H1:H100, “>” & DATE(2025,1,1))  
       Counts dates after Jan 1, 2025.  
     – Can also reference a cell: “>” & A1 where A1 holds a date.

4. Special Behaviors  
   • Blanks vs. non‑blanks  
     – COUNTIF(A1:A10, “”) counts empty cells.  
     – COUNTIF(A1:A10, “<>”) counts cells that are not empty.  
   • Mixed data types  
     – Numbers in quotes (e.g. “5”) are treated as text, not numeric.  
   • Logical values and errors  
     – COUNTIF will ignore TRUE, FALSE, and error values unless they match the criteria exactly.  
   • Whole‑column ranges (e.g. K:K)  
     – Scans all 1,048,576 rows; includes blank cells in the count.  
     – Use with care on very large sheets (performance).

5. Common Uses  
   • Count specific status  
     – COUNTIF(StatusRange, “Completed”)  
   • Count above/below thresholds  
     – COUNTIF(ScoreRange, “>=80”)  
     – COUNTIF(ScoreRange, “<50”)  
   • Partial text matching  
     – COUNTIF(NameRange, “Mc*”) finds names starting with “Mc”.  
   • Compare to another cell  
     – COUNTIF(DateRange, “<” & DeadlineCell)  
   • Unique‑value test  
     – COUNTIF($K:$K, K10)=1 returns TRUE if K10 is unique in column K.

6. Locking References  
   • $A$1:$A$10 locks both column & row (never shifts)  
   • A$1 locks row only (column shifts when copying across)  
   • $A1 locks column only (row shifts when copying down)  
   • $K:$K locks entire column K  
   • $K$10:$K$17 locks block K10–K17  

7. Relative vs. Absolute Ranges  
   • Relative range (K10:K17) will “drift” when copied down (→ K11:K18, K12:K19, etc.)  
   • Use absolute ranges ($K$10:$K$17 or $K:$K) to keep the lookup area fixed  

8. Multiple Criteria  
   • Use COUNTIFS for AND logic:  
     COUNTIFS(Range1, Criteria1, Range2, Criteria2, …)  
   • For OR logic, combine multiple COUNTIFs or use SUMPRODUCT

9. Tips  
   • Always enclose operators (>, <, <>) in quotes and concatenate with & for cell refs.  
   • Use wildcards (*, ?) for flexible text matches.  
   • When testing uniqueness, include a non‑blank check:  
     =AND(K10<>"", COUNTIF($K:$K, K10)=1)  
   • Keep ranges tight (avoid entire columns) for better performance.  

We can use =ISODD(any cell of the selected area) to allow only odd values across the selected area
Same goes for =ISEVEN()
Similarly =ISTEXT(any cell of the selected area) can be used to only allow texts
Same goes for =ISNUMBER()

Quick Guide: Introduction to Pivot Tables in Excel

1. What Is a Pivot Table?  
   • An interactive summary tool that automatically aggregates, analyzes, and presents large data sets.  
   • Lets you “pivot” (re‑arrange) rows and columns to see different perspectives.

2. When to Use Pivot Tables  
   • You have a detailed table of records (e.g., sales transactions, survey responses).  
   • You need quick totals, averages, counts, or subgroup analyses by category.  
   • You want an easy drag‑and‑drop interface instead of complex formulas.

3. Basic Components  
   • **Rows area**: Fields you want listed down the side (e.g., Salesman, District).  
   • **Columns area**: Fields you want across the top (e.g., Month, Item).  
   • **Values area**: Numeric fields to summarize (e.g., Sales TK) — default is “Sum,” can change to “Count,” “Average,” etc.  
   • **Filters area**: Fields to filter the entire report (e.g., Year, Region).

4. Creating a Pivot Table  
   1. Select any cell in your data table.  
   2. Go to **Insert → PivotTable**.  
   3. Choose where to place it (new worksheet or existing).  
   4. Click **OK**.

5. Building the Layout  
   • Drag fields from the Field List into Rows, Columns, Values, and Filters.  
   • Rearrange fields to change the view.  
   • Right‑click a Value and choose **Value Field Settings** to switch from Sum to Count, Average, Min, Max, etc.

6. Common Analyses  
   • **Total sales by salesman**: Rows = Salesman; Values = Sum of Sales TK.  
   • **Sales by month and district**: Rows = Month; Columns = District; Values = Sum of Sales TK.  
   • **Count of transactions by item**: Rows = Item; Values = Count of Item.

7. Tips & Tricks  
   • **Refresh** after data changes: Right‑click PivotTable → Refresh.  
   • **Group dates**: Right‑click a Date/Month field → Group → choose Years, Quarters, Months.  
   • **Show % of total**: Value Field Settings → Show Values As → % of Grand Total or % of Row/Column Total.  
   • **PivotChart**: Click inside PivotTable → PivotChart for dynamic charts.  
   • **Slicers** (Excel 2010+): Insert → Slicer to add clickable filters.

8. Keep in Mind  
   • Source data should have no blank header names and no completely blank rows/columns.  
   • Use an Excel Table (Insert → Table) as your source to allow dynamic range growth.  
   • PivotTables do not automatically update when you add new columns—refresh and ensure the source range covers them.

Keep this cheat‑sheet handy next time you need to slice and dice your data in seconds!

   • Always set **Alt Text** for accessibility and clear documentation.

Keep this guide handy to tweak your PivotTable’s behavior, appearance, and performance—without hunting through every menu each time!

PivotTable Options – Layout & Format

1. Accessing the Dialog  
   • Right‑click inside the PivotTable → PivotTable Options… → Layout & Format tab  
   • Or Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Options → Layout & Format

2. Layout Settings  
   • Autofit column widths on update  
     – When checked, Excel resizes PivotTable columns to fit new data when you Refresh.  
     – Uncheck to preserve your manual column widths.  
   • Preserve cell formatting on update  
     – Keeps any custom fonts, colors, number formats, or cell borders you apply—even after Refresh.  
   • Merge and center cells with labels  
     – Combines identical item labels into one merged cell for a cleaner look.  
     – Unmerge to show each row label in its own cell.  
   • Display field captions and filter drop‑downs  
     – Toggles the header row with field names and the little filter arrows on/off.  
   • For empty cells show: ___  
     – Enter text (e.g. “0” or “N/A”) to display instead of a blank.  
   • Display error values as: ___  
     – Replace error codes (#DIV/0!, #N/A, etc.) with custom text.  
   • Show items with no data on rows/columns  
     – Include items that exist in the field’s source but have no matching records in the current filter context.  
   • Classic PivotTable layout (enables dragging fields in grid)  
     – Switches to pre‑2007 layout where you can place and move fields directly inside the table grid rather than in the Field List.  
   • Enable show details  
     – Allows you to double‑click a summary value cell to see the underlying source rows in a new sheet.

3. Format Settings  
   • Autofit row heights on update  
     – (If available) Resizes row height to fit wrapped text when refreshing.  
   • Preserve formatting of number cells  
     – Keeps your numeric formatting (currency, percentages, decimals) intact on refresh.  
   • Use built‑in PivotTable style  
     – Choose or change the overall style (banded rows/columns, header colors) from the Design tab rather than custom formatting.

PivotTable Options – Totals & Filters

1. Accessing PivotTable Options  
   • Right‑click anywhere in the PivotTable → PivotTable Options…  
   • Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Options (leftmost button)  

2. Totals & Filters Tab (in PivotTable Options dialog)  
   This tab controls how subtotals and grand totals behave, and how filters are applied.

   A. Subtotals  
      • Do “Automatic” subtotals: Excel applies the default (SUM) subtotal under each group.  
      • Do “None”: turn off all subtotals.  
      • Do “Custom...”: choose which fields show subtotals and pick functions (SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, etc.).  

   B. Grand Totals  
      • For Rows and Columns:  
         – Show grand totals for rows only  
         – Show grand totals for columns only  
         – Show grand totals for both  
         – Off for both (no grand totals anywhere)  

   C. Filters  
      • “Allow multiple filters per field”  
         – Enables you to apply more than one Label or Value filter to the same field.  
      • “Merge and center cells with labels”  
         – When filtering hides items, this option merges remaining label cells for visual clarity.  

3. Field‑Level Totals & Filters (Ribbon / Field Settings)  
   For each Row or Column field you can override global settings:

   A. Subtotals & Filters in Field Settings  
      1. Right‑click a field name in the Row/Column area → Field Settings…  
      2. Subtotals & Filters tab allows:  
         – Subtotal options: Automatic, None, or Custom Function list  
         – Filter options:  
             • Label Filters (e.g. Begins With, Does Not Equal)  
             • Value Filters (e.g. Top 10 Items, Greater Than)  

   B. Changing Subtotal Function  
      • In Custom Subtotals: select one or more functions (Sum, Count, Average, Max, Min, etc.).  

4. Using Report Filters vs. Slicers  
   • Report Filter area (Filter Field):  
     – Drag a field into the “Filters” box in the Field List.  
     – Displays above the PivotTable as a dropdown—select one or multiple items.  
   • Slicers (Excel 2010+):  
     – Insert → Slicer after selecting PivotTable.  
     – Visual, clickable buttons; can format color and style.  

5. Label & Value Filters (Row/Column Fields)  
   • Label Filters (text fields in Row/Column):  
     – Equals, Does Not Equal, Begins With, Ends With, Contains, Does Not Contain, Greater Than, Less Than (lexical).  
   • Value Filters (numeric fields in Row/Column):  
     – Top 10, Above/Below Average, Greater Than, Less Than, Between, Equals, Does Not Equal.

6. Turning Off Filters & Totals Quickly (Design Tab)  
   • Design → Subtotals  
     – Do Not Show Subtotals / Show All Subtotals at Top/Bottom of Group  
   • Design → Grand Totals  
     – On for Rows and Columns / On for Rows Only / On for Columns Only / Off for Rows and Columns  
   • Design → Report Layout  
     – Show in Tabular Form (forces subtotals below; better for viewing)  
     – Show in Outline Form  
     – Show in Compact Form (default)  

7. Best Practices & Tips  
   • Disable unnecessary subtotals/grand totals to reduce clutter if you only need a specific summary.  
   • Use Custom Subtotals sparingly—too many functions slow recalculation.  
   • Use “Allow multiple filters per field” to refine multi‑layered filters without removing prior criteria.  
   • Remember to Refresh after changing options or source data (PivotTable Analyze → Refresh).  
   • Combine Report Filters with Slicers for interactive dashboards.  
   • Lock the PivotTable position (Options → Layout & Format → Enable/Disable “Autofit column widths on update”) to keep your report layout stable.

PivotTable Options – Display

1. Accessing the Display Tab  
   • Right‑click inside the PivotTable → PivotTable Options… → Display  
   • Or on the Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Options → Display

2. Show Expand/Collapse Buttons  
   • Toggles the little “+” and “–” icons next to grouped items.  
   • When ON you can click to drill into or collapse details right in the report.  
   • When OFF all items remain expanded or collapsed as last set, and no icons appear.

3. Display Field Captions & Filter Drop‑Downs  
   • Controls the header row above your PivotTable.  
   • ON: shows each field name with its funnel icon for filtering.  
   • OFF: hides headers and arrows for a cleaner look—use only when no further filtering is needed.

4. Display Context Tooltips  
   • When hovering over a value cell, a small popup shows the field path (e.g., “Region > Month > Sales”).  
   • Helps you confirm which row/column fields and items produced that number.  
   • Turn OFF to reduce on‑screen clutter if you’re already familiar with your layout.

5. Show Properties in Tooltip  
   • Extends the context tooltip to include item metadata (like source cell, record count, custom properties).  
   • Useful when you’ve attached additional attributes to items via OLAP or Data Model fields.  
   • OFF for simpler tooltips showing only field/item names.

6. Show Drilled‑Down Items  
   • Controls whether double‑clicking a summary cell automatically creates a new sheet with all underlying detail rows.  
   • ON: double‑click opens “show details” sheet.  
   • OFF: double‑click does nothing—prevents accidental drill into very large tables.

7. Show Context Menu  
   • ON: right‑clicking a PivotTable cell shows the full PivotTable context menu (refresh, field settings, group, etc.).  
   • OFF: limits right‐click to standard cell menu—locks the PivotTable structure.

8. Show Filter Fields per Column/Row  
   • When using multiple row or column fields, this ensures each field has its own filter arrow in the header.  
   • OFF can tidy up space by showing only the top‐level field’s arrow.

9. Practical Tips  
   • Disable expand/collapse icons if your audience may be confused by them.  
   • Hide captions and drop‑downs in a finalized report to prevent accidental changes.  
   • Use context tooltips during design; turn them off in a published dashboard for a cleaner look.  
   • Lock down “drill‑down” if your source data is huge to avoid massive new sheets.  

PivotTable Options – Printing

1. Accessing the Printing Tab  
   • Right‑click inside the PivotTable → PivotTable Options… → Printing  
   • Or on the Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Options → Printing

2. Print Row and Column Headers  
   • ON: repeats row labels on each printed page so you always know which category each row belongs to.  
   • OFF: prints labels only where they first appear (default Excel behavior).

3. Repeat Row Labels  
   • ON: prints the row field’s item label on every single row, not just the first row of each group.  
     – Useful when exporting to reports or PDFs so each line is self‑contained.  
   • OFF: shows the label only at the start of each grouped section.

4. Print Filter Fields  
   • ON: includes any Report Filter fields (and their selections) at the top of each printed page.  
     – Helps readers know which filters were applied when viewing printed reports.  
   • OFF: omits filter settings from the printout.

5. Print Page Field Labels  
   • ON: prints the names of page (report) filter fields above the PivotTable.  
   • OFF: suppresses these headings to save space.

6. Page Break Options  
   • Automatic Page Breaks  
     – Excel inserts page breaks based on your current page size, margins, and PivotTable layout.  
   • Manual Page Breaks  
     – You can insert your own breaks: Page Layout → Breaks → Insert Page Break.  
   • Keep Page Breaks  
     – ON: preserves manual breaks even after refreshing or changing the PivotTable layout.  
     – OFF: Excel may move or remove manual breaks on update.

7. Fit to Page Settings  
   • Adjust in Page Layout → Scale to Fit:  
     – Width/Page(s): fit the PivotTable to a set number of pages wide.  
     – Height/Page(s): fit to a set number of pages tall.  
   • Useful when printing wide PivotTables.

8. Print Gridlines and Headings  
   • In Excel’s Page Layout tab (not in Pivot Options), you can choose to print cell gridlines and row/column headings.  
   • TIP: Toggle these on for more spreadsheet‑like appearance, or off for a cleaner look.

9. Practical Tips  
   • Preview before printing: File → Print to check pagination.  
   • Use “Repeat Row Labels” in tabular form reports so each line shows its category.  
   • Include filter settings on printed pages when sharing with stakeholders.  
   • Lock manual page breaks if your report layout is final.  
   • Combine with “Autofit column widths” (Layout & Format tab) for best print fitting.

PivotTable Options – Data

1. Accessing the Data Tab  
   • Right‑click inside the PivotTable → PivotTable Options… → Data  
   • Or on the Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Options → Data

2. Refresh Control  
   • “Refresh data when opening the file”  
     – ON: PivotTable automatically updates from its source each time you open the workbook.  
     – OFF: Requires manual Refresh (PivotTable Analyze → Refresh or right‑click → Refresh).

3. Background Refresh (for external connections)  
   • ON: Allows Excel to refresh the PivotTable’s external data in the background so you can continue working.  
   • OFF: Excel waits until the refresh completes before you can do anything else.

4. Save Source Data with File  
   • ON: Embeds a copy of all the PivotTable’s source records in the workbook.  
     – Enables offline “Show Details” drilling even if the original data isn’t available.  
     – Increases file size.  
   • OFF: Doesn’t store source data—drill‑down only works if the source is accessible.

5. Number of Items to Retain per Field  
   • Determines how many distinct item names Excel caches for each field.  
     – Automatic: keeps old items even if they’re filtered out, useful for consistent pivot layout.  
     – None: drops all unused items from the cache, reduces file size but loses old items.  
     – Max: specify a custom number of items to retain.  
   • Use None or a low Max to minimize file size when your source constantly changes.

6. Enable Drill‑Down (“Show Details”)  
   • Controls whether double‑clicking a summary cell reveals its underlying records in a new sheet.  
   • If you stored source data with the file, drill‑down works offline.  
   • Disable if you want to prevent accidental generation of large detail sheets.

7. PivotTable Data Source  
   • Button to view or change the source range, table, or OLAP/PowerPivot connection.  
   • Ensures your PivotTable is pointing at the correct cells, table, or external data model.

8. Retain Formatting and Sorting on Update  
   • Optionally keep number formats, cell styles, and manual sort orders intact when the pivot refreshes.  
   • Uncheck to reset formatting and sorting to default each time you refresh.

9. Practical Tips  
   • Turn ON “Refresh when opening” for dashboards that must always show current data.  
   • Use Background Refresh with large external queries to avoid UI freezes.  
   • Save source data only if you need offline drill‑down—otherwise, turn it OFF for smaller file size.  
   • Choose “None” for items to retain if your fields have high cardinality (many unique values).  
   • Regularly review and clear old cache items (PivotTable Analyze → Options → Data → Clear Old Items).

PivotTable Tools – Group

1. Accessing the Group Feature  
   • Select one or more items in a Row or Column area of the PivotTable.  
   • Right‑click → Group…  
   • Or on the Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze → Group Field (in the Active Field group)

2. Manual Grouping of Items  
   • Select multiple contiguous items (e.g. “East”, “North”).  
   • Group… creates a new “Group1” field containing just those items.  
   • Rename the group in the PivotTable Fields list to something meaningful (e.g. “Regions A”).  
   • You can group existing groups again for nested hierarchy.

3. Date/Time Grouping  
   • Select a single date field in Rows or Columns.  
   • Group… opens options for:  
     – **By Months, Quarters, Years, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds**  
     – Check multiple levels for multi‑level grouping (Year + Quarter + Month).  
   • Click OK to insert each grouping level as its own field.  
   • Use the +/– icons to expand or collapse date hierarchy.

4. Numeric Grouping  
   • Select one or more numeric items (e.g. ages, sales values) or the entire numeric field.  
   • Group… lets you define:  
     – **Starting at:** the minimum number in your groups  
     – **Ending at:** the maximum number  
     – **By:** interval size (e.g. group ages by 10 → 0–9, 10–19, etc.)  
   • Excel builds bins of equal width; you can rename the bin labels.

5. Ungrouping  
   • To remove a group:  
     – Select any item in that group → Right‑click → Ungroup  
   • For date/numeric groups, Ungroup restores the original field.  
   • For manual groups, Ungroup deletes the group field entirely.

6. Group Settings & Options  
   • In the Group dialog you can:  
     – Adjust Start, End, and By values for numeric bins.  
     – Check “By” units for date groupings.  
   • After grouping, fields appear under the original field in the Field List; you can reorder or remove them.  
   • To rename a group (for clarity), select the group name in the Row/Column labels, press F2, and type a new label.

7. Multiple Group Levels  
   • You can apply numeric or date grouping on top of manual grouping for multi‑layer analysis.  
   • Drill‑down with expand/collapse buttons to move through levels.

8. Best Practices & Tips  
   • Always sort your source data chronologically or numerically before grouping to avoid unexpected bin boundaries.  
   • Use meaningful group names—double‑click the default “Group1” in Row labels to rename.  
   • Limit bin sizes to useful ranges; too many tiny bins clutter the report.  
   • Remember to Refresh the PivotTable after changing source data; grouped fields retain settings.  
   • Use Ungroup when you need to adjust group definitions—then reapply grouping with new parameters.

PivotTable Tools – Sort

1. Accessing Sort Controls  
   • Click the drop‑down arrow next to any Row or Column label in your PivotTable.  
   • Or on the Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze → Sort (in the Active Field group) → Sort A to Z / Z to A / More Sort Options.

2. Sort by Label (Item Name)  
   • **Ascending (A → Z)**: orders items alphabetically or numerically low → high.  
   • **Descending (Z → A)**: orders items reverse alphabetical or high → low.  
   • Applies to the selected field only; other fields remain in their current order.

3. Sort by Value  
   • In the drop‑down arrow choose **More Sort Options…**  
     – Select **“Sort by Value”** instead of by item name.  
     – Choose the **Summary Value** (Sum of Sales, Count of Records, etc.).  
     – Pick Ascending or Descending.  
   • Useful for ranking items by total sales, counts, averages, etc., rather than name.

4. Manual Drag‑and‑Drop Sorting  
   • In **Classic PivotTable layout** (Layout & Format → Classic Layout), you can drag Row labels up or down to any order.  
   • Or in the Field List under Rows/Columns, drag items within a field to reorder them manually.

5. Custom List Sorting  
   • Excel custom lists let you sort by a preset order (e.g. Jan, Feb, Mar… or High, Medium, Low).  
   • Go to PivotTable Analyze → Sort → More Sort Options → More Options → **“Use custom lists when sorting”**.  
   • Ensure your custom list is defined in File → Options → Advanced → Edit Custom Lists.

6. Sorting Multiple Fields  
   • If you have nested Row fields, sort the **top field** first, then sort each **sub‑field** individually.  
   • Use the drop‑down on each field’s label to set its own sort order.

7. Sort Options Dialog  
   • **More Sort Options…** from the label drop‑down opens the dialog:  
     – Specify **Sort type**: Manual, Ascending by label, or Descending by value.  
     – Click **More Options…** to sort items with no data at the bottom, or to sort left‑to‑right for column fields.

8. Persistent Sorting on Refresh  
   • In PivotTable Options → Layout & Format, uncheck **“Autofit column widths on update”** to keep manual widths.  
   • In PivotTable Options → Data, set **“Number of items to retain per field”** to avoid reintroducing old items that could disrupt sort.

9. Best Practices & Tips  
   • Always sort the **highest‑level** field first to establish overall order.  
   • Use **Value sort** for ranking rather than alphabetical label sort.  
   • Combine **custom lists** with manual groups for industry‑specific orders.  
   • Refresh after changing source data but verify sort order remains correct—reapply if needed.  
   • For large pivot tables, avoid too many manual reorders; use custom lists or value sorts for consistency.

PivotTable Tools – Data Group

1. Where to Find It  
   • Click anywhere in your PivotTable → Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Data group (middle of the tab)  

2. Refresh  
   • **Refresh** (single icon)  
     – Updates the active PivotTable from its current source (re‑reads any changed cell values in the source range or table).  
     – Shortcut: Select the PivotTable and press Alt + F5.  
   • **Refresh All**  
     – Updates every PivotTable and data connection in the entire workbook.  
     – Shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + F5.  

3. Change Data Source  
   • Opens the dialog to redefine the PivotTable’s source:  
     – Switch from a static range (e.g. A1:D100) to an Excel Table (dynamic) or vice versa.  
     – Expand or shrink the range if your data size has changed.  
     – Change connection string if you’re using an external data model/OLAP source.  
   • Best Practice: Use an Excel Table (Insert → Table) so the Pivot auto‐expands when you add rows.

4. Connections (Existing Connections)  
   • Opens the **Workbook Connections** dialog:  
     – Lists all external data sources (databases, OLAP, OData feeds) and data model queries.  
     – Allows you to **Add**, **Remove**, or **Edit** connection properties (e.g. authentication, command text).  
     – Control background refresh and caching options per connection.  

5. Data Source Settings (for Data Model / Power Pivot)  
   • If your Pivot uses the Data Model, click **Data Source Settings** under Connections:  
     – Manage which tables and relationships feed the model.  
     – Change Privacy Levels, Command Timeout, or Fast Data Load options.  

6. Clear  
   • While in many versions Clear lives under its own group, sometimes it’s included here:  
     – **Clear Filters**: removes all report‐level & field filters.  
     – **Clear All**: resets the PivotTable layout and filters back to blank.  

7. Select  
   • Again, occasionally grouped here—enables quick selection of:  
     – **Entire PivotTable**  
     – **Labels** only  
     – **Values** only  
   • Useful before copying, formatting, or clearing parts of the PivotTable.

8. Practical Tips  
   • **Always Refresh** after changing source data. If you skip this, the Pivot won’t reflect updates.  
   • Use **Refresh All** when you have multiple Pivots or external queries.  
   • **Change Data Source** before adding new fields—prevents orphaned or misaligned data.  
   • Review **Connections** to disable unused queries and improve workbook performance.  
   • Convert raw data ranges to Tables to let your Pivot automatically grow without manual “Change Data Source.”

   • Or Insert → PivotChart if starting from raw data (automatically creates linked PivotTable).

2. PivotChart Fields Pane  
   • Appears alongside your chart, mirroring the PivotTable Field List.  
   • Drag fields into:  
     – **Axis (Categories):** defines the X‑axis groupings (e.g. Month, Region).  
     – **Legend (Series):** splits data series (e.g. Product, Salesman).  
     – **Values:** numeric data to plot (e.g. Sum of Sales, Count of Orders).  
     – **Filters:** report‑level filters that apply to both chart and table.

3. Dynamic Interaction  
   • **Filtering:** click a chart element (bar, slice) → context menu → Filter → Hide Selected/Show Only Selected.  
   • **Drill‑down:** double‑click a data point to drill into underlying Pivot levels (if enabled).  
   • **Slicers & Timelines:** insert to control both PivotTable and PivotChart simultaneously.

4. Chart Tools Context Tabs

5. Synchronization with PivotTable  
   • Any change in the PivotTable (filters, grouping, sorting) immediately updates the PivotChart.  
   • Refreshing the PivotTable also refreshes the chart data.

6. Customizing Data Series  
   • Right‑click a series → Format Data Series →:  
     – Change series chart type (e.g. mix column & line).  
     – Adjust gap width, overlap, or plot on secondary axis.  
   • Add Data Labels → show values, percentages, or custom text on each data point.

7. Axis & Legend Configuration  
   • Axis Titles & Chart Title → add or edit text for clarity.  
   • Legend Position → move to top, bottom, left, right, or hide entirely.  
   • Axis Options → scale (min/max), tick marks, label position, number format.

8. Practical Tips  
   • Use **Combo Charts** (e.g. column + line) to compare different metrics.  
   • Leverage **Secondary Axis** for series with different scales.  
   • Apply **Slicers** for intuitive, clickable filtering of chart data.  
   • Consistently format PivotCharts in dashboards for a unified look.  
   • Remember: resizing or moving the PivotTable may reposition the linked PivotChart.

PivotChart Tools – Change Chart Type

1. Opening the Change‑Chart‑Type Window  
   • Select the PivotChart, then on the ribbon click Chart Design → Change Chart Type  
   • Or right‑click any blank area of the chart and choose Change Chart Type…

2. Available Chart Categories  
   • Column & Bar  
     – Clustered, Stacked, 100% Stacked  
     – Best for comparing values across categories  
   • Line & Area  
     – Line, Stacked Area, 100% Stacked Area  
     – Ideal for showing trends over time or continuous series  
   • Pie & Doughnut  
     – Single‑series “parts‑of‑a‑whole” views  
     – Use only when you have one data series and a few categories  
   • Combo  
     – Mix two chart types (e.g. Column + Line)  
     – Check Secondary Axis to give one series its own scale  
   • Scatter & Bubble (less common)  
     – For true X‑Y relationships—rare in pivoted data  

3. Building a Combo Chart  
   1. In the Change Chart Type dialog, select Combo  
   2. For each series, choose its chart type from the dropdown  
   3. Tick Secondary Axis for series with different magnitude  
   4. Click OK to apply and see both types combined  

4. Switching Row/Column Data  
   • On the Chart Design tab, click Switch Row/Column  
   • Transposes your series vs. category axes—helpful if your data groups look better the other way around  

5. Recommended Defaults for PivotCharts  
   • Clustered Column for side‑by‑side category comparisons  
   • Stacked Column/Bar to show totals plus breakdowns  
   • Line for time‑series or continuous data  
   • 100% Stacked to compare relative contributions across categories  
   • Combo when you need to overlay two different metrics  

6. Changing an Individual Series Type  
   • Right‑click the specific data series → Change Series Chart Type…  
   • Select a different chart style or assign it to the secondary axis without altering others  

7. Setting Your Own Default  
   • In Change Chart Type → All Charts → Set as Default Chart  
   • Makes your chosen type the automatic start‑point for new PivotCharts  

8. Best Practices  
   • Arrange your pivot fields (Rows vs. Columns) before picking a chart type  
   • Avoid 3D charts—they can distort perception of values  
   • After changing type, verify axis scales and data labels for readability  
   • Use combo charts judiciously; too many types can confuse viewers  
   • Remember to refresh the PivotTable to update the chart if source fields change

   • Hide field buttons once filters are set to streamline the chart’s appearance.  
   • Keep the Field List accessible during design; hide it for presentation.  
   • Remember to Refresh after updating source data so your analysis stays current.  

PivotChart Tools – Shape Styles Group

1. Quick Shapes  
   • Select a shape (textbox, annotation, drawn shape) in the chart → Format tab → Quick Styles  
   • Gallery of preset style combinations (fill, outline, effects) for rapid formatting  
   • Hover to preview before clicking to apply  

2. Shape Fill  
   • Format → Shape Fill

   • Categories:  
     – Shadow: Outer, Inner, Perspective presets, plus custom color/size/transparency  
     – Glow: outer glow color and size controls  
     – Soft Edges: smooth the shape’s border with adjustable radius  
     – Bevel: add depth with preset or custom Top/Bottom Width & Height  
     – 3‑D Rotation: tilt and perspective settings, lighting angle  
   • Use moderately to enhance prominence without clutter  

5. Reset Shape  
   • Format → Reset Shape  
   • Clears all manual fill, outline, and effect formatting, restoring the current Quick Style  

6. Best Practices  
   • Use Quick Styles for consistent look across multiple shapes and charts  
   • Match shape fill and outline colors to your workbook’s theme for professional cohesion  
   • Apply subtle effects (soft edges, slight shadows) to call out annotations without distraction  
   • Reset shapes when copying between charts with different themes to avoid mismatched styles  

PivotChart Tools – WordArt Style Group

1. Purpose  
   • The **WordArt Styles group** in the *Format* tab of PivotChart Tools allows you to apply artistic text effects to chart elements that support text (like titles, labels, or text boxes).
   • It enhances visual appeal and helps emphasize specific parts of your chart.

2. Components in the WordArt Styles Group:

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

A. **Quick WordArt Styles**
   • Predefined text style presets combining fill, outline, and effects.
   • To use:
     – Select the chart text element (e.g., Chart Title)
     – Go to Format tab → Click on a WordArt style
     – Hover to preview before clicking to apply

B. **Text Fill**
   • Format → Text Fill  
   • Options:
     – Theme Colors / Standard Colors / More Fill Colors (for custom RGB or HEX)
     – Gradient Fill: smooth color transitions
     – Picture or Texture Fill: apply image or texture to the text
     – No Fill: makes the text transparent (usually not recommended)

C. **Text Outline**
   • Format → Text Outline  
   • Options:
     – Color: choose border color for text
     – Weight: set the thickness of the outline
     – Dashes: apply dashed outlines for stylized appearance
     – No Outline: removes any stroke/border

D. **Text Effects**
   • Format → Text Effects  
   • Categories:
     – Shadow: outer/inner/perspective shadows for 3D look
     – Reflection: mirror-like reflection beneath the text
     – Glow: colored outer glow with adjustable size/intensity
     – Bevel: adds raised/engraved edge look (3D effect)
     – 3-D Rotation: tilts text to create a 3D appearance
   • These effects are especially useful for headings or special callouts

3. Reset WordArt
   • Reverts all text formatting (fill, outline, effects) back to the default chart theme style

4. Best Practices
   • Use sparingly—excessive effects can distract from the data
   • Match WordArt colors with your chart theme for consistent visuals
   • Great for chart titles or specific annotations—not ideal for data labels or axis text

PivotChart Tools – Arrange Group

1. Selection Pane  
   • Home → Find & Select → Selection Pane (or Format tab → Selection Pane)  
   • Lists all chart objects (shapes, text boxes, pictures) in z‑order  
   • Use Show/Hide icons to toggle visibility and drag to reorder layering  

2. Bring Forward / Send Backward  
   • Format tab → Arrange group →  
     – **Bring Forward** / **Bring to Front**: moves the selected object one step or all the way above others  
     – **Send Backward** / **Send to Back**: moves the selected object one step or all the way behind others  
   • Useful for layering annotations, logos, or shapes without disrupting chart elements  

3. Selection & Visibility  
   • Selection Pane also lets you rename items for clarity (double‑click name)  
   • Hide objects temporarily without deleting  

4. Align  
   • Format tab → Align → options:  
     – **Align Left/Center/Right**, **Align Top/Middle/Bottom**  
     – **Distribute Horizontally** / **Distribute Vertically** for even spacing  
     – **Snap to Grid** / **Snap to Shape** toggle  
   • Apply to multiple selected shapes/text boxes to keep annotations neat  

5. Group / Ungroup  
   • Select multiple objects (hold Ctrl) → Format tab → Group → Group  
   • Treat complex annotations as a single object for moving/resizing  
   • Ungroup breaks them back into individual elements  

6. Rotate  
   • Format tab → Rotate → options:  
     – **Rotate Right 90°** / **Rotate Left 90°**  
     – **Flip Vertical** / **Flip Horizontal**  
     – **More Rotation Options…** for precise angle input  
   • Handy for adjusting text box or shape orientation within the chart  

7. Practical Tips  
   • Use the Selection Pane to manage complex overlays and ensure correct stacking order  
   • Group shapes and text boxes that belong together to avoid accidental misalignment  
   • Align and distribute controls help maintain consistency when adding multiple annotations  
   • Rotate sparingly—over‑tilted labels can reduce readability  

PivotChart Tools – Size Group

1. Height & Width  
   • Format tab → Size group → directly set the **Height** and **Width** of the selected chart or object  
   • Values are in inches or centimeters depending on your Excel settings  
   • Ensures precise sizing—especially useful when maintaining uniform chart sizes in reports or dashboards  

2. Dialog Box Launcher (Size and Properties)  
   • Click the small arrow in the bottom-right corner of the Size group to open the **Format Chart Area** pane  
   • Go to **Size & Properties** (icon: square with measurements)  
   • Options include:  
     – **Lock aspect ratio**: maintains shape proportions when resizing  
     – **Relative to original picture size** (for images)  
     – **Position** tab for setting exact location using horizontal and vertical coordinates  
     – **Rotation** for angled display (input degrees manually)  

3. Resize with Mouse  
   • Click and drag chart corners or edges to resize manually  
   • Hold Shift to lock aspect ratio while resizing  
   • Use Alt to snap to gridlines or cells  

4. Locking and Protection  
   • In Format pane → **Properties** section:  
     – Set whether the object moves/resizes with cells or stays fixed  
     – Choose to **lock** the object to prevent accidental changes (can be combined with worksheet protection)  

5. Practical Tips  
   • Use exact height/width for uniform layout in presentations  
   • Lock aspect ratio to prevent distortion of charts or images  
   • Combine position & size settings to align multiple charts neatly  
   • Use "Lock object" when distributing templates to avoid user errors

PivotChart Tools – Active Field Group

1. Active Field Dropdown  
   • Located at the left of the PivotChart Analyze tab  
   • Shows a list of all Row, Column & Filter fields currently in the chart’s underlying PivotTable  
   • Use to quickly switch which field you’re working on without changing your chart layout  

2. Field Settings  
   • Click Field Settings to open the settings for the selected field in the dropdown  
   • Adjust Subtotals, Report Layout (Show items in outline/tabular form), and Filter options for that field  
   • Any changes immediately update both the PivotTable and PivotChart  

3. Move Up / Move Down  
   • Reorders the selected field within the Rows or Columns area of the PivotTable  
   • Click Move Up to shift the field higher (outer level) or Move Down to nest it deeper (inner level)  
   • Changes the grouping hierarchy and how categories display on the chart  

4. Remove Field  
   • Removes the selected field from the PivotTable (and PivotChart) entirely  
   • Use when you no longer need that dimension on your chart  
   • Equivalent to unchecking the box in the Field List, but quicker when focused on one field  

5. Tips  
   • Always select the correct Active Field before applying filters or formatting  
   • Reorder fields to change the chart’s grouping & drill‑down flow  
   • Use Remove Field to declutter a chart when switching to a different analysis  

PivotTables – Create, Grouping, Calculated Fields, Refresh & Slicers

1. Creating a PivotTable  
   • Select any cell in your source data (ideally formatted as an Excel Table).  
   • Go to Insert → PivotTable.  
   • Choose New Worksheet or Existing Worksheet and click OK.  
   • PivotTable Fields pane appears—drag fields into Filters, Columns, Rows, Values.

2. Grouping Items  
   • Manually group labels: select contiguous items in a Row or Column → right‑click → Group.  
   • Numeric/date grouping: select one numeric or date field item → right‑click → Group… → set Start/End and By (intervals or time units).  
   • Ungroup: right‑click a grouped item → Ungroup to restore original items.

3. Calculated Fields & Items  
   • Insert a Calculated Field (formula based on other fields):  
     – PivotTable Analyze → Fields, Items & Sets → Calculated Field.  
     – In dialog, name it (e.g. “Profit”) and enter formula (e.g. `=Revenue - Cost`).  
     – Click Add → OK; new field appears in Values.  
   • Calculated Items (formulas inside a single field):  
     – PivotTable Analyze → Fields, Items & Sets → Calculated Item.  
     – Use to combine or manipulate items (e.g. “East+West” as a new region).  
   • Remember: both recalculate when source data changes; too many can slow performance.

4. Refreshing Data  
   • Manual Refresh: select PivotTable → PivotTable Analyze → Refresh (or right‑click → Refresh).  
   • Refresh All: PivotTable Analyze → Refresh All (updates all Pivots & connections in workbook).  
   • Auto‑refresh on open: PivotTable Options → Data tab → check Refresh data when opening the file.  
   • Background Refresh for external connections keeps Excel responsive during large data loads.

5. Using Slicers  
   • Insert Slicer: select PivotTable → PivotTable Analyze → Insert Slicer → check one or more fields → OK.  
   • A floating panel of buttons appears—click to filter the PivotTable/PivotChart instantly.  
   • Multi‑select: hold Ctrl while clicking buttons.  
   • Clear filter: click the funnel icon in the Slicer header.  
   • Format Slicer: use Slicer Tools → Options to change style, columns, button size.  
   • Connect one Slicer to multiple Pivots: Slicer Tools → Report Connections → check boxes.

Keep this guide where you can grab each step in seconds—no more hunting through menus!  

Logical Functions – IF, AND, OR, NOT, IFS

1. IF  
   • Structure:  IF(logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false)  
   • Tests one condition and returns one of two results.  
     – Example:  =IF(A1>100, "High", "Low")  
       • If A1 > 100 returns “High,” otherwise “Low.”  
   • Nesting IFs (pre‑2021):  
     – =IF(A1>100, "High", IF(A1>50, "Medium", "Low"))  
     – Can become complex with many levels—consider IFS.

2. AND, OR, NOT  
   • AND(condition1, condition2, …)  
     – Returns TRUE only if ALL conditions are TRUE.  
     – Example: =AND(A1>0, B1<10)  
   • OR(condition1, condition2, …)  
     – Returns TRUE if ANY condition is TRUE.  
     – Example: =OR(A1="Yes", B1="Yes")  
   • NOT(condition)  
     – Reverses a logical value: TRUE → FALSE, FALSE → TRUE.  
     – Example: =NOT(C1="Complete")  (TRUE if C1 ≠ “Complete”)

3. IFS (Excel 2016+ / 365)  
   • Structure:  IFS(test1, value1, test2, value2, …, [TRUE, default])  
   • Evaluates tests in order and returns the first matching value.  
     – Example: =IFS(A1>100, "High", A1>50, "Medium", A1>=0, "Low", TRUE, "N/A")  
   • No need to nest multiple IFs; cleaner and easier to read.

4. Combining with Other Functions  
   • IF + AND/OR for multi‑condition logic:  
     – =IF(AND(A1>0, B1<5), "Valid", "Invalid")  
   • IFERROR to catch errors:  
     – =IFERROR(1/0, "Error!") returns “Error!” instead of #DIV/0!  
   • Use logical functions in array formulas for bulk logical tests (Office 365).

5. Common Pitfalls & Tips  
   • Blank vs. zero: ISBLANK(A1) or A1="" to test emptiness.  
   • Comparisons are case‑insensitive: "Yes" = "yes".  
   • Order matters in IFS—place most specific tests first.  
   • Avoid deep nesting; switch to IFS or lookup tables (VLOOKUP / XLOOKUP) for complex branching.  
   • Always include a default catch‑all (e.g. TRUE, "Other") as the last IFS pair.  

Lookup & Reference – VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, XLOOKUP

1. VLOOKUP  
   • Structure:  VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index, [range_lookup])  
   • lookup_value: value to find in first column of table_array  
   • table_array: block of cells (e.g. A1:D100)  
   • col_index: column number to return (1 = first column)  
   • range_lookup: FALSE for exact match, TRUE (or omitted) for approximate  
   • Example: =VLOOKUP(B2, Products!$A$2:$C$100, 3, FALSE)  
   • Pitfalls:  
     – Only searches left‑to‑right  
     – Requires first column sorted for approximate matches  
     – Exact match must use FALSE  

2. HLOOKUP  
   • Structure:  HLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, row_index, [range_lookup])  
   • Same logic as VLOOKUP but searches in first row, returns from row_index  
   • Example: =HLOOKUP("Jan", Sales!$A$1:$M$5, 4, FALSE)  
   • Pitfalls:  
     – Only top‑to‑bottom  
     – Range must be sorted for TRUE  

3. INDEX  
   • Two forms:  
     – Array form: INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num])  
     – Reference form: INDEX(reference, row_num, [col_num], [area_num])  
   • Returns value at intersection of row_num & column_num  
   • Example: =INDEX(A2:C10, 5, 2) returns value in row 5, column 2 of that range  
   • Use with MATCH for flexible lookups  

4. MATCH  
   • Structure:  MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])  
   • lookup_array: single row or column  
   • match_type: 0 for exact, 1 for <= (sorted ascending), -1 for >= (sorted descending)  
   • Returns position (number) of found item in lookup_array  
   • Example: =MATCH("Widget X", A2:A50, 0) returns the row offset  

5. INDEX + MATCH  
   • Combines strengths:  
     – Lookup in any column/row, not limited to first  
     – No need to sort for exact matches  
   • Example: =INDEX(C2:C50, MATCH(E2, A2:A50, 0))  
     – Finds E2 in A2:A50, returns corresponding C column value  

6. XLOOKUP (Excel 365/2021+)  
   • Structure: XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found], [match_mode], [search_mode])  
   • if_not_found: value when no match (default #N/A)  
   • match_mode: 0 exact, -1 exact or next smaller, 1 exact or next larger, 2 wildcard  
   • search_mode: 1 first‑to‑last, -1 last‑to‑first  
   • Example: =XLOOKUP(E2, A2:A50, C2:C50, "Not found", 0, 1)  
   • Advantages:  
     – Lookup left or right, vertical or horizontal  
     – Built‑in error handling  
     – Supports wildcards and reverse search  

7. Common Tips & Pitfalls  
   • Always lock ranges with $ when copying formulas  
   • Use exact match (FALSE or 0) to avoid unexpected results  
   • For large data sets, INDEX/MATCH or XLOOKUP are faster than VLOOKUP  
   • XLOOKUP replaces most legacy lookups—use it when available  
   • Remember to handle #N/A with if_not_found or IFERROR  

Keep this note handy to choose the right lookup method and avoid common errors!  

Ctrl + Shift + arrow selects all the arrow direction cells in an area, Shift + arrow selects immidiate arrow direction row or column based on the arrow
Seelcting a range (e.g., C11:D13) and cliking F4 will lock them using $, clicking F4 multiple times lets you lock individually (e.g., C$11, $C11, $C$11)

Text Functions – CONCATENATE, LEFT, RIGHT, MID, TRIM, LEN, SUBSTITUTE

1. CONCATENATE (or CONCAT in newer Excel)  
   • Structure: CONCATENATE(text1, text2, …)  
   • Joins multiple text strings into one.  
     – Example: =CONCATENATE(A1, " ", B1) merges first and last name with a space.  
   • Newer: =CONCAT(A1, " ", B1)  
   • TIP: Use TEXTJOIN(delimiter, ignore_empty, range1, …) to join ranges with a delimiter and skip blanks.

2. LEFT  
   • Structure: LEFT(text, [num_chars])  
   • Returns the leftmost characters from a string.  
     – Example: =LEFT("Report2025", 6) → "Report"  
   • num_chars defaults to 1 if omitted.  
   • If num_chars > length, returns the entire string.

3. RIGHT  
   • Structure: RIGHT(text, [num_chars])  
   • Returns the rightmost characters.  
     – Example: =RIGHT("Report2025", 4) → "2025"  
   • num_chars defaults to 1.  
   • If num_chars > length, returns the entire string.

4. MID  
   • Structure: MID(text, start_num, num_chars)  
   • Extracts a substring starting at a position.  
     – Example: =MID("Spreadsheet", 6, 5) → "sheet" (starts at 6th character, length 5)  
   • If start_num > length, returns "".  
   • If start_num + num_chars exceeds length, returns up to the end.

5. TRIM  
   • Structure: TRIM(text)  
   • Removes extra spaces: leading, trailing, and reduces multiple spaces between words to one.  
     – Example: =TRIM("  Hello   World  ") → "Hello World"  
   • Does NOT remove non‑breaking spaces (use CLEAN for non‑printables).

6. LEN  
   • Structure: LEN(text)  
   • Returns the number of characters in a string, including spaces.  
     – Example: =LEN("Excel Tips") → 10  
   • Useful to pair with LEFT/RIGHT/MID to calculate dynamic lengths.

7. SUBSTITUTE  
   • Structure: SUBSTITUTE(text, old_text, new_text, [instance_num])  
   • Replaces occurrences of old_text with new_text.  
     – Example: =SUBSTITUTE("A-B-A-B", "B", "X") → "A-X-A-X"  
     – To replace only the 2nd instance: =SUBSTITUTE("A-B-A-B","B","X",2) → "A-B-A-X"  
   • Case‑sensitive.  
   • For case‑insensitive, use UPPER/LOWER wrappers.

8. Common Tips & Pitfalls  
   • Always wrap cell references in TEXT() when concatenating numbers with formats: =TEXT(A1,"0.00")  
   • Remember Excel treats everything as text when joined—use VALUE() to convert back to number.  
   • Combine TRIM and CLEAN(text) to strip extra spaces and non‑printable characters before processing.  
   • Use LEN in formulas like =LEN(A1)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1,"a","")) to count occurrences of a character.  

Date Functions – TODAY, NOW, DATE, YEAR, MONTH, DAY, EOMONTH

1. TODAY()  
   • Structure: TODAY()  
   • Returns the current date (no time).  
   • Volatile: updates each time the workbook recalculates or opens.  
   • Example: =TODAY() → 2025‑07‑17 (if that’s today’s date)

2. NOW()  
   • Structure: NOW()  
   • Returns current date and time.  
   • Volatile: updates on recalculation/open.  
   • Example: =NOW() → 2025‑07‑17 14:35

3. DATE()  
   • Structure: DATE(year, month, day)  
   • Builds a valid date from numeric parts.  
   • Handles out‑of‑range inputs by rolling over (e.g. month 13 → Jan of next year).  
   • Example: =DATE(2025,7,1) → 2025‑07‑01

4. YEAR, MONTH, DAY  
   • YEAR(date) → extracts the year number  
     – =YEAR(A1) returns 2025 if A1 is 2025‑07‑17  
   • MONTH(date) → extracts the month (1–12)  
     – =MONTH(A1) returns 7 if A1 is July  
   • DAY(date) → extracts the day of month (1–31)  
     – =DAY(A1) returns 17 if A1 is the 17th  

5. EOMONTH()  
   • Structure: EOMONTH(start_date, months)  
   • Returns the last day of the month, offset by “months” from start_date.  
     – months = 0 → end of the same month  
     – months = 1 → end of next month  
     – months = -1 → end of previous month  
   • Example: =EOMONTH("2025-07-17", 0) → 2025‑07‑31

6. Combining & Formatting Tips  
   • To get first day of month: =DATE(YEAR(A1), MONTH(A1), 1)  
   • To add business days: use WORKDAY or WORKDAY.INTL, not HERE  
   • Format dates with TEXT(date, "yyyy‑mm‑dd") for consistency in concatenations  
   • Beware that TODAY/NOW recalc on any change—use manual calculation mode if needed

Excel Custom Date Formats: d, dd, ddd, dddd

Purpose: Control how dates display in Excel by defining day formats (numeric and weekday names).

1. d
   - Displays: Day of month without leading zero.
   - Range: 1–31
   - Example: For March 5, 2025 → 5

2. dd
   - Displays: Day of month with two digits (adds leading zero if needed).
   - Range: 01–31
   - Example: For March 5, 2025 → 05

3. ddd
   - Displays: Abbreviated weekday name.
   - Example: For March 5, 2025 (Wednesday) → Wed

4. dddd
   - Displays: Full weekday name.
   - Example: For March 5, 2025 → Wednesday

How Excel Interprets Repeated Letters:
- Runs of identical letters form a single instruction (e.g., dddd is one token: full weekday name).
- More than four letters (e.g., ddddd) behaves like four letters (dddd).

Usage Examples:
- `ddd, mmm dd, yyyy` → Wed, Mar 05, 2025
- `dddd, mmmm d"th"` → Wednesday, March 5th

Tip: Combine tokens (d, m, y) to build custom date displays matching your reporting or presentation needs.

Aggregation Functions – SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, AVERAGEIFS

1. Function Structures  
   • SUMIFS(sum_range, criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2], …)  
   • COUNTIFS(criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2], …)  
   • AVERAGEIFS(average_range, criteria_range1, criteria1, [criteria_range2, criteria2], …)

2. Parameters  
   • sum_range / average_range: the cells to sum or average (for COUNTIFS omit this)  
   • criteria_rangeN: the range to test for each condition  
   • criteriaN: the test (number, expression, text, wildcard, or cell ref)

3. Criteria Types  
   • Number or exact text: “=5”, “Apple”  
     – Example: criteria1 = 5 or "Completed"  
   • Comparison operators: “>100”, “<=50” (must be in quotes)  
   • Wildcards:  
     – “East*” for any text starting with “East”  
     – “?at” for any three‑letter text ending in “at”  
   • Cell references: “>” & A1, “<>” & B1  
   • Dates: “>=” & DATE(2025,1,1) or “<” & C1 (where C1 holds a date)

4. Examples  
   • Sum sales in North region in July:  
     =SUMIFS(SalesRange, RegionRange, "North", MonthRange, "July")  
   • Count orders >100 and status = “Shipped”:  
     =COUNTIFS(OrderQty, ">100", StatusRange, "Shipped")  
   • Average score for group A or B:  
     =AVERAGEIFS(ScoreRange, GroupRange, "A", GroupRange, "B")  
     (Note: to OR groups, use two SUMIFS/COUNTIFS or a filtered subset)

5. Key Behaviors & Notes  
   • All ranges must be the same size and shape; mismatched ranges cause #VALUE!  
   • COUNTIFS and AVERAGEIFS allow multiple AND conditions only.  
   • For OR logic, sum multiple SUMIFS or wrap COUNTIFS in SUM:  
     =SUM(SUMIFS(...Group="A"...), SUMIFS(...Group="B"...))  
   • Blank criteria: use “” to test blanks, "<>" to test non‑blanks.  
   • Criteria ranges can be whole columns (e.g. A:A), but may impact performance.

6. Locking References  
   • Use $A$1:$A$100 to fix ranges when copying formulas  
   • Mix $A1 or A$1 to lock only row or column as needed  
   • Ensure sum/average ranges stay aligned with criteria ranges

7. Tips & Best Practices  
   • Place the most restrictive criteria first for readability  
   • Avoid entire‑column ranges on large workbooks to speed up calculations  
   • Use named ranges or structured table references for clarity  
   • Wrap SUMIFS in IFERROR to handle “no match” cases:  
     =IFERROR(SUMIFS(...), 0)  
   • Validate with COUNTIFS that your SUMIFS scope is correct before averaging  

Keep this note handy to build powerful multi‑condition aggregations without confusion!  

If a formula isn't dynamic (adding a new row or column to the area doesn't update the formulas) then convert the area into table and it will make the formula dinamic

Data Cleaning – Text to Columns, Remove Duplicates & Flash Fill

1. Text to Columns  
   • Access: Select column → Data tab → Text to Columns  
   • Delimited vs. Fixed Width:  
     – **Delimited**: split on commas, tabs, spaces, or custom characters  
     – **Fixed Width**: split at specified character positions  
   • Steps for Delimited:  
     1. Choose Delimited → Next  
     2. Check delimiters (Comma, Tab, Space, Other) → Next  
     3. Set each column’s Data Format (General, Text, Date) → Finish  
   • Use to parse “First Last” into two columns or CSV data into separate fields

2. Remove Duplicates  
   • Access: Select range or entire table → Data tab → Remove Duplicates  
   • Choose which columns to consider when identifying duplicates  
   • Click OK to delete all but the first instance of each duplicate record  
   • Use on headers-included tables to clean survey responses or transaction logs

3. Flash Fill  
   • Access: Start typing desired pattern in adjacent column → Data tab → Flash Fill  
   • Or type Ctrl + E after the first example  
   • Automatically fills down based on detected pattern (extract, combine, format)  
     – Examples: extract first names from “John Smith” or convert “20250717” to “2025-07-17”  
   • Works only when Excel senses a consistent pattern—verify results for edge cases

Tips & Best Practices  
   • Always keep a backup of raw data before cleaning  
   • Use “Undo” (Ctrl+Z) immediately if results aren’t as expected  
   • Convert ranges to Tables (Ctrl+T) so cleaning operations auto-expand with new data  
   • Combine techniques: e.g., Text to Columns → Remove Duplicates → Flash Fill for final polish  

Ctrl + Shift + + is used to insert a row or column
Placing (*) in find will select all the values within () and we can then replace with something or nothing
Alt + H + V + V will paste only values 
Ctrl + - will delete an entire selected column
Ctrl + Space will select an entire column
Alt + W + V  + G is the shortcut for removing gridlines
Ctrl + E is the sortcut for flash fill

Charts – Bar, Column, Line, Pie, Combo & Sparklines

1. Column Charts  
   • Use for comparing values across categories (e.g. sales by region).  
   • Variants: Clustered, Stacked, 100% Stacked, 3‑D Column.  
   • Tips:  
     – Keep category labels short and rotate if they overlap.  
     – Use 100% Stacked to show proportion of totals.

2. Bar Charts  
   • Similar to Column but horizontal—use when category names are long.  
   • Variants: Clustered, Stacked, 100% Stacked, 3‑D Bar.  
   • Tips:  
     – Ideal for ranking items (e.g. top 10 products).  
     – Sort data descending for a “waterfall” effect.

3. Line Charts  
   • Show trends over time or continuous data (e.g. monthly revenue).  
   • Variants: Line, Stacked Line, 100% Stacked Line, Line with Markers.  
   • Tips:  
     – Use markers for key data points only.  
     – Avoid too many lines—limit to 3–5 series for clarity.

4. Pie Charts  
   • Display parts‑of‑a‑whole for a single data series.  
   • Variants: Pie, 3‑D Pie, Doughnut.  
   • Tips:  
     – Limit to 5–7 slices; combine small ones into “Other.”  
     – Label slices with percentages or use a legend—avoid both.

5. Combo Charts  
   • Combine two chart types (e.g. Column + Line) for different metrics.  
   • Assign one series to a Secondary Axis when scales differ.  
   • Tips:  
     – Use for comparing volume and rate (e.g. sales vs. growth rate).  
     – Keep secondary axis clearly labeled to avoid confusion.

6. Sparklines  
   • Mini‑charts within a single cell showing trend or variance.  
   • Types: Line, Column, Win/Loss.  
   • Insert: Select cells → Insert → Sparklines → choose type → specify data range.  
   • Tips:  
     – Use in tables for quick trend spotting.  
     – Avoid excessive formatting—sparklines should be sleek and consistent.

7. Best Practices Across Chart Types  
   • Always add a clear title and axis labels.  
   • Use consistent color palettes—limit to 3–5 colors.  
   • Remove gridlines and borders that don’t add meaning.  
   • Include data labels sparingly to highlight key values.  
   • Preview in Print Layout if you’ll share as a report.  

Ctrl + F1 will automatically insert a chart for the selected area, a default chart will be inserted, you can change the default chart by choosing a chart and right click to set as default
Clicking F11 on selected data will also create a chart out of it but on a different sheet

Macros Recording – Quick Guide

1. Enable the Developer Tab  
   • File → Options → Customize Ribbon → check “Developer” → OK  
   • Access Record, Visual Basic, and Macro tools there.

2. Record a Macro  
   1. Developer → Record Macro  
   2. Name: enter a valid name (no spaces, start with letter)  
   3. Shortcut key (optional): Ctrl+letter (case‑sensitive if using Ctrl+Shift)  
   4. Store macro in:  
      – This Workbook (default)  
      – Personal Macro Workbook (available in all workbooks)  
      – New Workbook  
   5. Description: note what it does → OK  
   6. Perform the actions you want to automate  
   7. Developer → Stop Recording (or click the square icon)

3. Run a Macro  
   • Developer → Macros → select macro name → Run  
   • Or use your assigned Ctrl+ shortcut  
   • Or assign to a button/form control (see below)

4. View & Edit VBA Code  
   • Developer → Macros → select macro → Edit → opens the VBA Editor  
   • Alt+F11 also opens VBA Editor  
   • Locate your macro under Modules in Project Explorer

5. Assign Macro to a Button or Shape  
   1. Developer → Insert → choose Button (Form Control) or Shape  
   2. Draw it where you want on the sheet  
   3. In the Assign Macro dialog, pick your macro → OK  
   4. Right‑click the button/shape → Edit Text to rename

6. Macro Security Settings  
   • File → Options → Trust Center → Trust Center Settings → Macro Settings  
     – Disable all macros with notification (default)  
     – Disable all except digitally signed macros  
     – Enable all macros (not recommended)  
   • Store personal macros in Personal.xlsb in the XLSTART folder

7. Relative vs. Absolute References  
   • Developer → Use Relative References before recording  
     – Relative: macro acts on the active cell location  
     – Absolute: macro uses exact cell addresses

8. Best Practices  
   • Give macros meaningful names and descriptions  
   • Comment your VBA code (’ at line start) for clarity  
   • Test macros on sample data before production  
   • Avoid hard‑coding ranges—use dynamic references where possible  
   • Backup your workbook (or Personal.xlsb) before adding macros  
   • Keep macros in Personal Macro Workbook for reuse across files

Alt + H + MC is the shortcut for Merge and Center
Alt + H + H will take you to setting background color of a cell
Alt + H + FC takes you to the font color

Stage 2: SQL Fundamentals (Weeks 3–4)

Database Concepts – Tables, Schemas, Primary/Foreign Keys & Indexes

1. Tables  
   • Definition: Structured collection of related data organized in rows (records) and columns (fields).  
   • CREATE:  
     ‒ CREATE TABLE table_name (  
     ‒   column1 datatype [constraints],  
     ‒   column2 datatype [constraints],  
     ‒   …  
     ‒ );  
   • Data Types: INT, VARCHAR(n), DATE, DECIMAL(p,s), BOOLEAN, etc.  
   • ALTER: add, modify or drop columns after creation (ALTER TABLE).

2. Schemas  
   • Definition: Logical container or namespace for database objects (tables, views, procedures).  
   • Purpose: Organize objects, manage permissions, avoid name collisions.  
   • CREATE:  
     ‒ CREATE SCHEMA schema_name;  
   • Usage:  
     ‒ schema_name.table_name to qualify cross‑schema references.  
     ‒ GRANT/REVOKE permissions at schema level.

3. Primary Keys  
   • Definition: Uniquely identifies each row in a table.  
   • Characteristics:  
     ‒ NOT NULL, UNIQUE, minimal (single or composite).  
   • Declaration:  
     ‒ Inline: id INT PRIMARY KEY,  
     ‒ Or out‑of‑line: PRIMARY KEY (column1, column2).  
   • Purpose: Ensures row uniqueness, used by foreign keys and indexes.

4. Foreign Keys  
   • Definition: Column(s) in one table that reference primary key(s) of another.  
   • Declaration:  
     ‒ CREATE TABLE orders (  
     ‒   order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,  
     ‒   customer_id INT,  
     ‒   FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)  
     ‒ );  
   • Options:  
     ‒ ON DELETE CASCADE / SET NULL / RESTRICT  
     ‒ ON UPDATE CASCADE / SET DEFAULT  
   • Purpose: Enforce referential integrity between related tables.

5. Indexes  
   • Definition: Data structure that improves query performance on one or more columns.  
   • Types:  
     ‒ Single‑column: CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table(col);  
     ‒ Composite: CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table(col1, col2);  
     ‒ Unique: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_name ON table(col);  
     ‒ Full‑text, Spatial (vendor‑specific).  
   • Considerations:  
     ‒ Speed up SELECT WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY.  
     ‒ Slow down INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE due to maintenance.  
     ‒ Use sparingly on high‑write tables.  
   • Drop: DROP INDEX idx_name ON table;

6. Best Practices  
   • Always define a primary key for every table.  
   • Use schemas to group related objects and manage access.  
   • Index columns used frequently in WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY.  
   • Avoid over‑indexing—monitor performance and index usage.  
   • Name conventions: prefix indexes (idx_), fkeys (fk_), tables plural (users).  

You can change the database from the ribbon where all availabe datasets are listed
You can also manually navigate and select it
You can use the command USE database_name
Use -- for single line comments and /* */ for multi line comments

Basic SQL Queries – SELECT, FROM, WHERE, DISTINCT

1. SELECT  
   • Purpose: Specify which columns to return.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT column1, column2, …  
     • Use * to select all columns: SELECT *  
     • Can rename with AS: SELECT first_name AS fname  

2. FROM  
   • Purpose: Specify the table(s) to query.  
   • Syntax:  
     FROM table_name  
     • Use schema qualification if needed: schema.table_name  
     • Multiple tables require JOIN or comma syntax (JOIN preferred).

3. WHERE  
   • Purpose: Filter rows based on conditions.  
   • Syntax:  
     WHERE condition1 [AND|OR condition2 …]  
   • Conditions support: =, <>, >, <, >=, <=, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, IS NULL  
   • Example:  
     WHERE age >= 18  
       AND status = 'active'  
       AND country IN ('US','CA')

4. DISTINCT  
   • Purpose: Remove duplicate rows in the result set.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, …  
   • Applies to the combination of listed columns.  
   • Example:  
     SELECT DISTINCT department  
     FROM employees  
     WHERE salary > 50000

5. Combined Example  
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT e.department AS dept, e.role, e.hire_date  
   FROM hr.employees AS e  
   WHERE e.status = 'active'  
     AND e.salary >= 60000;

For filtering the data before aggregation we use WHERE and for filtering after the aggregation we use HAVING
If we want a part of the query to execute, instead of commenting out the unwanted portion, we can simply select highlight the part that we want to execute and then click execute, and it will execute only that part of the query
DROP TABLE table_name deletes the entire table while DELETE FROM table_name or TRUNCATE TABLE table_name only deletes the data

SQL Filtering – AND, OR, NOT, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, IS NULL

1. AND  
   • Combines multiple conditions; all must be true.  
   • Example:  
     SELECT * FROM students  
     WHERE age > 18 AND enrolled = 'yes';

2. OR  
   • At least one condition must be true.  
   • Example:  
     SELECT * FROM courses  
     WHERE subject = 'Math' OR subject = 'Physics';

3. NOT  
   • Reverses a condition’s result.  
   • Example:  
     SELECT * FROM users  
     WHERE NOT status = 'inactive';

4. BETWEEN  
   • Checks if a value is within a range (inclusive).  
   • Example:  
     SELECT * FROM orders  
     WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';

5. IN  
   • Checks if a value matches any item in a list.  
   • Example:  
     SELECT * FROM employees  
     WHERE department IN ('HR', 'IT', 'Finance');  
   • Can also use with NOT:  
     WHERE department NOT IN ('Sales', 'Marketing');

6. LIKE  
   • Pattern matching using wildcards:  
     – `%` = any sequence of characters  
     – `_` = any single character  
   • Examples:  
     SELECT * FROM customers  
     WHERE name LIKE 'J%';  -- starts with 'J'  
     SELECT * FROM files  
     WHERE filename LIKE '%.pdf'; -- ends with '.pdf'  
     SELECT * FROM products  
     WHERE code LIKE 'A_1'; -- 'A' + any char + '1'

7. IS NULL / IS NOT NULL  
   • Checks for NULL (missing) values.  
   • Examples:  
     SELECT * FROM feedback  
     WHERE comments IS NULL;  
     SELECT * FROM feedback  
     WHERE comments IS NOT NULL;

8. Combining Conditions  
   • Use parentheses to control logic:  
     SELECT * FROM books  
     WHERE (genre = 'Sci-Fi' OR genre = 'Fantasy')  
       AND published_year >= 2010;

9. Notes  
   • AND has higher precedence than OR—use parentheses for clarity.  
   • BETWEEN is inclusive: includes boundary values.  
   • IN is cleaner than using many ORs.  
   • LIKE is case-sensitive in some databases (e.g. PostgreSQL), but not in others (e.g. MySQL by default).

Sorting & Limiting – ORDER BY, LIMIT, TOP

1. ORDER BY  
   • Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT columns  
     FROM table  
     ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC];  
   • Default: ASC (ascending)  
   • Example:  
     SELECT name, age  
     FROM students  
     ORDER BY age DESC, name ASC;

2. LIMIT (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)  
   • Restricts the number of rows returned.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT * FROM table  
     ORDER BY column  
     LIMIT n;  -- return top n rows  
   • Example:  
     SELECT * FROM sales  
     ORDER BY total DESC  
     LIMIT 10; -- top 10 highest sales

3. OFFSET (Used with LIMIT)  
   • Skips rows before starting to return results.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT * FROM table  
     ORDER BY column  
     LIMIT n OFFSET m; -- skip m rows, return next n  
   • Example:  
     SELECT * FROM employees  
     ORDER BY hire_date  
     LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10; -- rows 11–15 by hire date

4. TOP (SQL Server)  
   • Alternative to LIMIT for SQL Server & MS Access.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT TOP n *  
     FROM table  
     ORDER BY column DESC;  
   • Example:  
     SELECT TOP 3 name, score  
     FROM exams  
     ORDER BY score DESC;

5. FETCH FIRST (ANSI SQL / Oracle)  
   • Another alternative to LIMIT (standard SQL).  
   • Example:  
     SELECT * FROM customers  
     ORDER BY signup_date DESC  
     FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;

6. Notes  
   • Always pair ORDER BY with LIMIT/TOP for consistent results.  
   • ORDER BY can use column numbers: ORDER BY 2 DESC (2nd column).  
   • OFFSET is useful for pagination (e.g. showing results page by page).  
   • Avoid using LIMIT without ORDER BY—it may return unpredictable rows.

Aggregations – COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY & HAVING

1. COUNT  
   • COUNT(*)  
     – Counts all rows, including those with NULLs in other columns.  
   • COUNT(column)  
     – Counts only non‑NULL values in that column.  
   • COUNT(DISTINCT column)  
     – Counts unique non‑NULL values.  
   • Example:  
     SELECT COUNT(*)    AS total_orders,  
            COUNT(user_id) AS answered_surveys  
     FROM orders;

2. SUM  
   • SUM(numeric_column)  
     – Adds up all non‑NULL values.  
   • Returns NULL if no non‑NULL rows (use COALESCE to default to 0).  
   • Example:  
     SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_revenue  
     FROM sales;

3. AVG  
   • AVG(numeric_column)  
     – Calculates the mean of non‑NULL values.  
   • Ignores NULLs automatically.  
   • Example:  
     SELECT AVG(score) AS avg_score  
     FROM exam_results;

4. MIN & MAX  
   • MIN(column)  
     – Returns smallest value (numeric, date, or text).  
   • MAX(column)  
     – Returns largest value.  
   • Examples:  
     SELECT MIN(order_date) AS first_order,  
            MAX(order_date) AS latest_order  
     FROM orders;

5. GROUP BY  
   • Groups rows sharing the same values in listed columns.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT col1, col2, AGG_FUNC(col3)  
     FROM table  
     [WHERE ...]  
     GROUP BY col1, col2;  
   • Example:  
     SELECT department, SUM(salary) AS dept_payroll  
     FROM employees  
     GROUP BY department;

6. HAVING  
   • Filters groups after aggregation (WHERE cannot use aggregates).  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT col, AGG_FUNC(col2)  
     FROM table  
     GROUP BY col  
     HAVING AGG_FUNC(col2) > value;  
   • Example:  
     SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS num_emps  
     FROM employees  
     GROUP BY department  
     HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;

7. Combined Example  
   ```sql
   SELECT manager_id,
          COUNT(*)      AS team_size,
          AVG(sales)    AS avg_sales,
          MIN(sales)    AS min_sale,
          MAX(sales)    AS max_sale
   FROM sales_data
   WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-06-30'
   GROUP BY manager_id
   HAVING AVG(sales) > 10000
   ORDER BY team_size DESC;

Joins – INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER & CROSS

1. INNER JOIN  
   • Returns rows where the join condition matches in both tables.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT a.col1, b.col2  
     FROM tableA AS a  
     INNER JOIN tableB AS b  
       ON a.key = b.key;  
   • Example:  
     SELECT e.name, d.dept_name  
     FROM employees e  
     INNER JOIN departments d  
       ON e.dept_id = d.id;  
   • Only matching pairs appear in results.

2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)  
   • Returns all rows from the left table, plus matching rows from the right.  
   • Non‑matching right rows yield NULLs.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT a.*, b.*  
     FROM tableA a  
     LEFT JOIN tableB b  
       ON a.key = b.key;  
   • Example:  
     SELECT c.customer, o.order_id  
     FROM customers c  
     LEFT JOIN orders o  
       ON c.id = o.customer_id;  
   • Use to find “orphan” left‑side records with no match.

3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)  
   • Returns all rows from the right table, plus matching rows from the left.  
   • Non‑matching left rows yield NULLs.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT a.*, b.*  
     FROM tableA a  
     RIGHT JOIN tableB b  
       ON a.key = b.key;  
   • Example:  
     SELECT p.product, s.sale_id  
     FROM products p  
     RIGHT JOIN sales s  
       ON p.id = s.product_id;  
   • Useful when focusing on the right table’s completeness.

4. FULL OUTER JOIN  
   • Returns all rows when there is a match in either table.  
   • Non‑matching columns from either side yield NULLs.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT a.*, b.*  
     FROM tableA a  
     FULL OUTER JOIN tableB b  
       ON a.key = b.key;  
   • Example:  
     SELECT e.name, m.manager_name  
     FROM employees e  
     FULL OUTER JOIN managers m  
       ON e.manager_id = m.id;  
   • Combines LEFT and RIGHT JOIN; shows all records.

5. CROSS JOIN  
   • Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (every combination).  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT a.col, b.col  
     FROM tableA a  
     CROSS JOIN tableB b;  
   • Example:  
     SELECT p.product, d.discount_code  
     FROM products p  
     CROSS JOIN discounts d;  
   • Use sparingly—result size = rowsA × rowsB.

6. JOIN Tips & Best Practices  
   • Always qualify column names when joining (e.g., a.id, b.id) to avoid ambiguity.  
   • Prefer explicit JOIN syntax over comma‑separated tables for clarity.  
   • Index join columns to improve performance.  
   • Use INNER JOIN for filtering to matching records only; OUTER JOINs to retain unmatched rows.  
   • For FULL OUTER in MySQL (which lacks it), simulate with UNION of LEFT and RIGHT JOINs.  

Set Operations – UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT & EXCEPT

1. UNION  
   • Combines results of two queries into one result set, removing duplicates.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT col1, col2, …  
     FROM tableA  
     UNION  
     SELECT col1, col2, …  
     FROM tableB;  
   • Requirements: same number of columns and compatible data types in each SELECT.

2. UNION ALL  
   • Same as UNION but **keeps** duplicate rows.  
   • Syntax:  
     SELECT … FROM tableA  
     UNION ALL  
     SELECT … FROM tableB;  
   • Faster than UNION because it skips the duplicate elimination step.

3. INTERSECT  
   • Returns only rows **common** to both queries.  
   • Syntax (if supported):  
     SELECT … FROM tableA  
     INTERSECT  
     SELECT … FROM tableB;  
   • Eliminates duplicates in the result.

4. EXCEPT (or MINUS)  
   • Returns rows from the first query that **don’t** appear in the second.  
   • Syntax (SQL Server/PostgreSQL):  
     SELECT … FROM tableA  
     EXCEPT  
     SELECT … FROM tableB;  
   • Oracle uses MINUS instead of EXCEPT.  
   • Eliminates duplicates in the result.

5. Key Points  
   • Column order and types must match across all SELECTs.  
   • ORDER BY can only appear at the **end** of the final SELECT.  
   • Use UNION ALL when you need full combined data (including duplicates).  
   • INTERSECT & EXCEPT require database support (not in MySQL without workaround).  
   • Performance: set operations can trigger sorting/hash operations—index underlying tables where possible.  

Single‑Row Functions – Text, Numeric, Date/Time & Conversion

1. Text/String Functions

     – Absolute value.  
     – Example: ABS(-5) → 5  
   • ROUND(number, [decimals])  
     – Round to specified decimals.  
     – Example: ROUND(2.678,2) → 2.68  
   • TRUNC(number, [decimals])  
     – Truncate without rounding.  
     – Example: TRUNC(2.678,2) → 2.67  
   • CEIL(number) / FLOOR(number)  
     – Smallest integer ≥ / largest integer ≤ value.  
     – Example: CEIL(2.1) → 3; FLOOR(2.9) → 2  
   • MOD(number, divisor)  
     – Remainder of division.  
     – Example: MOD(10,3) → 1  

3. Date/Time Functions  
   • SYSDATE() / CURRENT_DATE  
     – Returns current date (DB server).  
   • EXTRACT(part FROM date)  
     – Pull year, month, day, etc.  
     – Example: EXTRACT(YEAR FROM '2025-07-17') → 2025  
   • TRUNC(date, format)  
     – Truncate to day/month/year.  
     – Example: TRUNC('2025-07-17','MM') → '2025-07-01'  
   • ROUND(date, format)

     – Fractional months difference.  
     – Example: MONTHS_BETWEEN('2025-07-17','2025-05-17') → 2  
   • NEXT_DAY(date, 'DAY')  
     – Next specified weekday.  
     – Example: NEXT_DAY('2025-07-17','MONDAY') → next Monday  

4. NULL Handling & Conversion  
   • NVL(expr, replacement) / COALESCE(expr1, expr2, …)  
     – Replace NULL with default.  
     – Example: NVL(phone,'N/A')  
   • TO_CHAR(value, format)  
     – Convert date/number to text.  
     – Example: TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'YYYY‑MM‑DD')  
   • TO_DATE(text, format)  
     – Parse text into date.  
     – Example: TO_DATE('2025‑07‑17','YYYY‑MM‑DD')  
   • CAST(expr AS datatype)  
     – Explicit type conversion.  
     – Example: CAST('123' AS INT) → 123  

5. Usage Tips  
   • Functions operate **per row** on input values before any grouping.  
   • Combine: SUBSTR(UPPER(name),1,1) for first‑letter initials.  
   • Be mindful of NULLs—wrap expressions in NVL/COALESCE if needed.  
   • Use format masks in TO_CHAR/TO_DATE to match locale and display needs.  
   • Index expressions (e.g. function(column)) may prevent index use—consider computed columns if performance critical.  

Date & Time Functions (SQL)

1. CURRENT_DATE & CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  
   • CURRENT_DATE  
     – Returns today’s date (no time).  
     – Example: SELECT CURRENT_DATE; → ‘2025-07-22’  
   • CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  
     – Returns current date and time with fractional seconds.  
     – Example: SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP; → ‘2025-07-22 14:35:12.123456’

2. DATE & TIME Constructors  
   • DATE ’YYYY-MM-DD’  
     – Literal date constant.  
     – Example: SELECT DATE ’2025-01-01’;  
   • TIME ’HH:MI:SS’  
     – Literal time constant.  
     – Example: SELECT TIME ’08:30:00’;  
   • TIMESTAMP ’YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS’  
     – Literal timestamp constant.  

3. EXTRACT(part FROM source)  
   • Pulls a component from date/time.  
   • Parts: YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND, etc.  
   • Example:  
     SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS yr,  
            EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS mon  
     FROM orders;

4. DATE_TRUNC(unit, timestamp)  
   • Rounds down to beginning of specified unit.  
   • Units: millennium, century, decade, year, quarter, month, week, day, hour, minute.  
   • Example:  
     SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) → ‘2025-07-01 00:00:00’;

5. DATE_ADD & DATE_SUB (MySQL)  
   • DATE_ADD(date, INTERVAL n unit)  
   • DATE_SUB(date, INTERVAL n unit)  
   • Units: SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, WEEK, MONTH, YEAR, etc.  
   • Example:  
     SELECT DATE_ADD('2025-07-22', INTERVAL 7 DAY) → ‘2025-07-29’;  

6. ADD_MONTHS & MONTHS_BETWEEN (Oracle/PostgreSQL)  
   • ADD_MONTHS(date, n)  
     – Adds n months, preserving day where possible.  
     – Example: ADD_MONTHS('2025-01-31',1) → ‘2025-02-28’;  
   • MONTHS_BETWEEN(date1, date2)  
     – Fractional number of months between dates.  

7. DATEDIFF (SQL Server/MySQL)  
   • DATEDIFF(unit, start, end)  
   • Units: year, quarter, month, day, hour, minute, second (SQL Server)  
   • Example:  
     SELECT DATEDIFF(day, '2025-07-01','2025-07-22') → 21;

8. INTERVAL Arithmetic (PostgreSQL)  
   • date + INTERVAL 'n unit'  
     – Example: CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '1 month';  
   • timestamp - timestamp  
     – Returns INTERVAL type (days, hours, minutes).  

9. Formatting & Conversion  
   • TO_CHAR(date, format)  
     – Formats date/time as text.  
     – Example: TO_CHAR(order_date,'DD-Mon-YYYY') → ‘22-Jul-2025’;  
   • TO_DATE(text, format) (Oracle/PostgreSQL)  
     – Parses text into DATE.  
   • CAST(expr AS DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP)  
     – Converts between types.  

10. Tips & Notes  
    • Functions and syntax vary by dialect—check your RDBMS docs.  
    • Use DATE_TRUNC for grouping by month/quarter in analytics.  
    • Avoid mixing date and string types without explicit conversion.  
    • Remember time zone considerations with TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE types.  

Window Functions – ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LEAD & LAG

1. ROW_NUMBER()  
   • Assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within a partition, based on the ORDER BY clause.  
   • Syntax:  
     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY partition_expr ORDER BY sort_expr [ASC|DESC])  
   • Example:  
     SELECT name, department,  
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank  
     FROM employees;  
   • Use for “top‑N per group” queries or to generate unique row IDs.

2. RANK()  
   • Assigns a ranking number to rows within a partition; ties receive the same rank, but gaps appear after ties.  
   • Syntax:  
     RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY partition_expr ORDER BY sort_expr)  
   • Example:  
     SELECT sales_rep, region,  
            RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sales DESC) AS region_rank  
     FROM sales;  
   • If two rows tie for rank 1, the next rank is 3.

3. DENSE_RANK()  
   • Similar to RANK(), but ranks are consecutive—no gaps after ties.  
   • Syntax:  
     DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY partition_expr ORDER BY sort_expr)  
   • Example:  
     SELECT product, category,  
            DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY units_sold DESC) AS category_rank  
     FROM inventory;  
   • If two items tie for rank 1, the next rank is 2.

4. LEAD()  
   • Accesses data from the next row (offset forward) within the partition.  
   • Syntax:  
     LEAD(value_expr, offset[, default]) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_expr ORDER BY sort_expr)  
   • Example:  
     SELECT date, revenue,  
            LEAD(revenue, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS next_day_revenue  
     FROM daily_sales;  
   • Use to compare current vs. next row values (e.g., trend analysis).

5. LAG()  
   • Accesses data from the previous row (offset backward) within the partition.  
   • Syntax:  
     LAG(value_expr, offset[, default]) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_expr ORDER BY sort_expr)  
   • Example:  
     SELECT date, revenue,  
            LAG(revenue, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS prev_day_revenue  
     FROM daily_sales;  
   • Use to compute differences between current and prior rows.

6. Common Notes  
   • All window functions require an OVER(...) clause.  
   • PARTITION BY defines groups; omit it to treat the entire result set as one partition.  
   • ORDER BY inside OVER controls the sequence for ranking or lead/lag.  
   • Window functions do not reduce row count—they return one result per input row.  
   • Combine with a WHERE or CTE to filter for specific ranks or trend conditions.  

Subqueries: Correlated & Non-Correlated

1. What is a Subquery?  
   • A subquery is a query nested inside another query (SELECT, FROM, or WHERE).  
   • It provides intermediate results used by the outer/main query.

────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Non-Correlated Subquery  
   • Executes independently of the outer query.  
   • Runs once and returns a single or multiple values.  
   • Commonly used in WHERE, FROM, or SELECT clauses.

   Example 1: Scalar subquery (returns one value)  
   SELECT name  
   FROM employees  
   WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);  

   Example 2: IN subquery (returns multiple values)  
   SELECT name  
   FROM employees  
   WHERE department_id IN (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE location = 'New York');  

   Characteristics:  
   - Inner query runs first.  
   - No dependency on outer query’s row.  
   - More performant than correlated subqueries.

────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Correlated Subquery  
   • Depends on each row of the outer query to execute.  
   • Executes once per row of the outer query.  
   • Typically used in WHERE or SELECT clauses.

   Example:  
   SELECT e.name  
   FROM employees e  
   WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary)  
                   FROM employees  
                   WHERE department_id = e.department_id);  

   Characteristics:  
   - Inner query refers to outer query’s columns (e.department_id).  
   - Slower for large data sets due to repeated execution.  
   - Useful for row-by-row comparisons (e.g., rank within group).

────────────────────────────────────────────
4. Subquery in FROM Clause (Inline View)  
   • Acts like a temporary table or view.  
   • Can be joined with other tables.

   Example:  
   SELECT dept, avg_sal  
   FROM (SELECT department_id AS dept, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal  
         FROM employees  
         GROUP BY department_id) AS dept_avg  
   WHERE avg_sal > 50000;

────────────────────────────────────────────
5. Subquery in SELECT Clause  
   • Useful for embedding a scalar calculation for each row.  

   Example:  
   SELECT name,  
          (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE tasks.emp_id = e.id) AS task_count  
   FROM employees e;

────────────────────────────────────────────
6. Tips  
   • Use correlated subqueries carefully—they’re powerful but can be slow.  
   • Always test subqueries independently when debugging.  
   • Prefer joins or CTEs if performance matters and logic permits.  

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

1. What is a CTE?  
   • A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.  
   • It improves readability, modularizes complex queries, and supports recursion.

2. Syntax  
   WITH cte_name AS (  
       SELECT ...  
   )  
   SELECT * FROM cte_name;

   • You can define multiple CTEs separated by commas:
     WITH cte1 AS (SELECT ...),  
          cte2 AS (SELECT ... FROM cte1)  
     SELECT * FROM cte2;

3. Example – Basic CTE  
   WITH dept_avg AS (  
       SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary  
       FROM employees  
       GROUP BY department_id  
   )  
   SELECT e.name, e.salary, d.avg_salary  
   FROM employees e  
   JOIN dept_avg d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

4. Benefits  
   • Improves query clarity by breaking complex logic into parts.  
   • Avoids repeating subqueries.  
   • Can be referenced multiple times within the main query.  
   • Replaces views for temporary operations.

5. Recursive CTE  
   • A CTE that calls itself to return hierarchical or sequential data.

   Syntax:  
   WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (  
       -- Anchor member  
       SELECT ...  
       UNION ALL  
       -- Recursive member  
       SELECT ... FROM cte_name WHERE condition  
   )  
   SELECT * FROM cte_name;

   Example – Numbers 1 to 5:  
   WITH RECURSIVE numbers AS (  
       SELECT 1 AS n  
       UNION ALL  
       SELECT n + 1 FROM numbers WHERE n < 5  
   )  
   SELECT * FROM numbers;

6. CTE vs Subquery  
   | Feature            | CTE                        | Subquery                    |  
   |--------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|  
   | Readability        | More readable               | Can be nested & confusing    |  
   | Reusability        | Can reference multiple times| Must repeat for reuse        |  
   | Recursion support  | Yes                         | No                           |  
   | Temporary storage  | Yes                         | Yes                          |  

7. Notes  
   • CTE only exists during execution of the query.  
   • ORDER BY inside a CTE does not affect final results unless combined with TOP, OFFSET, or used in final SELECT.  
   • Recursive CTEs must include a termination condition to avoid infinite loops.  

Case Statements, Aliases, Comments in SQL

────────────────────────────────────────────
1. CASE Statements  
   • Allows conditional logic within queries.  
   • Works like IF…ELSE in programming.

   Syntax:
   CASE  
       WHEN condition1 THEN result1  
       WHEN condition2 THEN result2  
       ...  
       ELSE resultN  
   END

   Example:
   SELECT name, salary,  
          CASE  
              WHEN salary > 70000 THEN 'High'  
              WHEN salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 70000 THEN 'Medium'  
              ELSE 'Low'  
          END AS salary_category  
   FROM employees;

   Notes:  
   - You can use CASE in SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, etc.  
   - Always include an `ELSE` to cover unmatched cases (optional but recommended).

────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Aliases  
   • Used to rename columns or tables for better readability.  
   • Improves clarity in joins, aggregations, and nested queries.

   Syntax:
   SELECT column_name AS alias_name  
   FROM table_name AS alias_name;

   Examples:
   SELECT name AS employee_name, salary * 12 AS annual_salary  
   FROM employees;

   SELECT e.name, d.name  
   FROM employees AS e  
   JOIN departments AS d ON e.department_id = d.id;

   Notes:  
   - `AS` keyword is optional in many SQL dialects.  
   - Table aliases are especially helpful in JOINs or subqueries.

────────────────────────────────────────────
3. Comments in SQL  
   • Used to explain code or disable parts of queries temporarily.  
   • Two types of comments:

   Single-line comment:
   -- This is a single-line comment

   Multi-line comment (not supported in all SQL engines like MySQL):
   /*  
      This is a  
      multi-line comment  
   */

   Example:
   SELECT name, salary  -- retrieving employee name and salary  
   FROM employees;

   Notes:  
   - Use comments to make complex queries easier to understand.  
   - In production, remove or minimize comments for performance in some systems.

────────────────────────────────────────────
Summary:
| Feature       | Purpose                                   |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| CASE          | Apply conditional logic in queries        |
| Aliases       | Rename columns/tables for clarity         |
| Comments      | Explain or disable parts of SQL code      |


Transactions & Basic Optimization in SQL

────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Transactions  
• A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations treated as a single logical unit of work.
• Ensures data integrity using **ACID** properties.

ACID Properties:
  - **Atomicity**: All steps succeed or none at all.
  - **Consistency**: Keeps the database in a valid state.
  - **Isolation**: Transactions don’t interfere with each other.
  - **Durability**: Once committed, changes are permanent.

Basic Transaction Commands:
  - `BEGIN` / `START TRANSACTION` – Starts a new transaction.
  - `COMMIT` – Saves all changes.
  - `ROLLBACK` – Undoes changes since the last BEGIN.
  - `SAVEPOINT` – Sets a point you can roll back to.
  - `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` – Rolls back to a specific point.

Example:
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;

If an error occurs, you can use ROLLBACK; to undo all changes.

Use Cases:
- Bank transfers
- Batch updates
- Ensuring data consistency in multi-step operations

────────────────────────────────────────────
2. Basic SQL Optimization  
• Optimization improves the performance and efficiency of queries.

Tips:

✅ Use SELECT only needed columns  
-- Bad  
SELECT * FROM employees;  
-- Good  
SELECT name, salary FROM employees;

✅ Use WHERE clauses to reduce scanned rows  
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'shipped';

✅ Use appropriate indexes  
- Create indexes on columns used in JOIN, WHERE, and ORDER BY.

✅ Avoid functions on indexed columns in WHERE  
-- Slower  
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2023  
-- Faster  
WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01' AND order_date < '2024-01-01'

✅ Avoid SELECT DISTINCT if not needed  
- DISTINCT is expensive. Only use it when necessary.

✅ Limit rows returned  
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10;

✅ Use EXISTS instead of IN for subqueries with large datasets  
-- Better  
SELECT name FROM customers c  
WHERE EXISTS (  
   SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.id  
);

✅ Analyze execution plans  
- Use EXPLAIN or QUERY PLAN tools to see how queries are executed.

Summary Table:

| Concept        | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Transactions   | Group SQL operations into a single unit     |
| COMMIT         | Finalizes changes made in transaction       |
| ROLLBACK       | Reverts changes made during transaction     |
| SAVEPOINT      | Creates rollback checkpoints                |
| Optimization   | Improves query performance and efficiency   |
| EXPLAIN PLAN   | Visualizes how queries are executed         |

Index – Detailed SQL Note (Including Storage & Organization Types)

1. What Is an Index?  
• A database object that speeds up data retrieval by creating a lookup structure on one or more columns.  
• Analogous to a book’s index: points directly to rows instead of scanning every page.

2. Index Types by Structure  
• **Clustered Index**  
  – Physically orders the table rows on disk to match the index key.  
  – Only one per table (because rows can be in only one order).  
  – Example (SQL Server):  
    CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_emp_id ON employees(employee_id);  
• **Non-Clustered Index**  
  – Separate structure that stores key values and row pointers (RID or clustering key).  
  – Can have many per table.  
  – Example:  
    CREATE INDEX idx_emp_lastname ON employees(last_name);  
• **Heap**  
  – A table without any clustered index; rows are stored in no particular order.  
  – Lookups rely on non-clustered indexes or full scans.

3. Index Types by Storage Model  
• **Rowstore Index** (traditional B-Tree)  
  – Organizes data row by row.  
  – Ideal for transactional (OLTP) workloads with frequent single-row lookups.  
• **Columnstore Index**  
  – Stores data column by column in compressed segments.  
  – Superior for analytical (OLAP) queries aggregating large data volumes.  
  – Example (SQL Server):  
    CREATE COLUMNSTORE INDEX idx_sales_cs ON sales(sale_date, amount);  
• **Clustered Columnstore**  
  – Replaces the base table with a columnstore format—no separate rowstore table.  
  – Best for data warehousing scenarios.

4. Specialized Indexes  
• **Full-Text Index**  
  – Supports word-based searches, ranking, inflections.  
  – Vendor-specific commands (e.g. CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX).  
• **Spatial Index**  
  – Optimized for geometric data types (points, polygons).  
  – Often R-tree or grid-based.  
• **Filtered / Partial Index**  
  – Indexes only rows matching a WHERE filter.  
  – Reduces index size and improves speed for sparse predicates.  
  – Example (PostgreSQL):  
    CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users(id) WHERE active = true;  
• **Function-Based / Expression Index**  
  – Indexes the result of an expression or function on a column.  
  – Example (Oracle):  
    CREATE INDEX idx_upper_name ON employees(UPPER(last_name));

5. Creating & Dropping Indexes  
• CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table_name(column1 [ASC|DESC], column2…);  
• DROP INDEX idx_name [ON table_name];  

6. When to Use Indexes  
• Columns in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, GROUP BY clauses.  
• High-cardinality columns (many distinct values).  
• Foreign key columns to speed referential checks.  
• Analytical queries on large fact tables—use columnstore.

7. When to Avoid or Limit Indexes  
• Small tables—full scans are fast and indexes add overhead.  
• Low-cardinality columns (e.g. gender flags).  
• High-write tables—each insert/update/delete must maintain indexes.  
• Redundant indexes—avoid overlapping single-column and composite indexes.

8. Index Maintenance & Optimization  
• **Rebuild/Reorganize** to defragment:  
  – SQL Server: ALTER INDEX ALL ON table REBUILD;  
  – Oracle: ALTER INDEX idx_name REBUILD;  
• **Monitor Usage** via DMVs or system catalogs (e.g. sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats, pg_stat_user_indexes).  
• **Adjust Fill Factor** for write-heavy tables to reduce page splits.  
• **Drop Unused** indexes to improve write performance.

9. Covering Indexes  
• Include non-key columns to satisfy queries entirely from the index—avoids lookups back to the table.  
• Example (SQL Server):  
  CREATE INDEX idx_sales_cover ON sales(sale_date) INCLUDE(amount, region);

10. Monitoring & Tuning  
• Use **EXPLAIN** or **EXPLAIN ANALYZE** to verify index usage vs. full scans.  
• Check **fragmentation** or **bloat** and schedule regular maintenance.  
• Leverage **filtered/partial** and **columnstore** indexes for targeted performance gains.

Performance & Optimization for Data Analysts – Indexing & Partitioning

1. Why It Matters  
   • Faster dashboards, reports, and ad-hoc queries—no more waiting minutes for results.  
   • Reduces server load and storage I/O, so more colleagues can run queries simultaneously.  
   • Enables handling of ever-growing data sets without starting from scratch.

────────────────────────────────────────────  
2. Indexing: Your Query “Shortcut”  

A. What Is an Index?  
   • Think of it like the back of a book—Excel doesn’t scan every row; it jumps to only relevant ones.  
   • Under the hood: B-Tree (rowstore) or compressed column segments (columnstore).

B. When to Use Rowstore (B-Tree) Indexes  
   • Point lookups and small ranges:  
     SQL: `WHERE customer_id = 123` or `sale_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31'`  
   • JOIN keys, foreign keys, GROUP BY and ORDER BY columns.  
   • Good default for OLTP and smaller fact tables.

C. When to Use Columnstore Indexes  
   • Scanning millions of rows for aggregates (SUM, AVG) across few columns.  
   • Data warehouse style queries: “Total sales by region per quarter.”  
   • Highly compressed—can reduce storage by 5–10× and run vectorized scans.

D. Designing Effective Indexes  
   1. **Selectivity**: index columns with many unique values first (e.g. transaction_id).  
   2. **Composite Index Order**: put the filter column most often used first:  
      - If you filter on `product_category` then `sale_date`, define `(product_category, sale_date)`.  
   3. **Covering Index**: add extra columns via INCLUDE (SQL Server) or INCLUDE clause (PostgreSQL) so your query never needs to “lookup” back to the table.  
   4. **Filtered/Partial Index**: index only rows you care about (e.g. `WHERE is_active = true`) to keep index small and fast.

E. Maintenance & Monitoring  
   • **Fragmentation**: monitor with DMVs or system views—rebuild when >30% fragmented.  
   • **Statistics**: auto-update on, but refresh manually after big loads (`ANALYZE`, `UPDATE STATISTICS`).  
   • **Usage Metrics**: identify unused indexes (`sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats`, `pg_stat_user_indexes`) and drop them to speed up writes.

────────────────────────────────────────────  
3. Partitioning: Splitting Big Tables into “Chunks”  

A. Why Partition?  
   • **Pruning**: queries with filters on the partition key (e.g. date) skip entire chunks—massive I/O savings.  
   • **Maintenance**: you can archive, rebuild, or delete old partitions (e.g. last year’s data) without touching current data.  
   • **Parallelism**: some engines scan different partitions on different CPU threads.

B. Common Partitioning Schemes  
   1. **Range**: ideal for dates—e.g. one partition per month or quarter.  
   2. **List**: for categorical splits—e.g. one partition per region (“North”, “South”, etc.).  
   3. **Hash**: distributes evenly when you can’t segment by date or list (e.g. user_id hash).  
   4. **Composite**: range + hash for high-volume date partitions that need sub-distribution.

C. Implementing Partitions (Conceptual)  
   • SQL Server: create a PARTITION FUNCTION (defines ranges) and a PARTITION SCHEME (maps to filegroups), then `CREATE TABLE … ON scheme`.  
   • Oracle/PostgreSQL/MySQL: use `PARTITION BY` clauses directly in `CREATE TABLE`.  

D. Partitioned Indexes  
   • **Local Index**: each partition has its own index—prunes together with the table.  
   • **Global Index**: a single index across all partitions—needed if you query on non-partition columns, but cannot prune as efficiently.

E. Managing Partitions  
   • **SPLIT / MERGE**: adjust boundaries—add new months or retire old ones.  
   • **SWITCH / EXCHANGE**: swap a data table in/out for fast archiving.  
   • **TRUNCATE PARTITION**: delete old data instantly (no logging).  
   • **Stats per Partition**: ensure the optimizer knows row counts per partition for accurate plans.

4. Putting It Together—A Data Analyst’s Checklist  
   1. **Analyze Your Workload**  
      – Use `EXPLAIN`/`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to see table scans vs. index seeks.  
      – Profile slow queries in your BI tool or database logs.  
   2. **Design Indexes**  
      – Start with columns in WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY.  
      – Build rowstore B-Trees for selective filters; add columnstore for heavy aggregates.  
   3. **Partition Large Tables**  
      – If your fact table exceeds tens of millions of rows, partition by date or region.  
      – Test “partition pruning” by filtering on the key—ensure only relevant partitions are scanned.  
   4. **Monitor & Maintain**  
      – Schedule index rebuilds/reorganizes and statistics updates during off-peak hours.  
      – Drop or disable unused indexes to speed up inserts/updates.  
      – Adjust fill factors to balance page density vs. updates.  
   5. **Iterate**  
      – Re-examine plans after major data volume changes (e.g. year-end loads).  
      – Archive old partitions and merge low-value ones to keep management overhead low.
