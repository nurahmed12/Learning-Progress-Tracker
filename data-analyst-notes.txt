Minimize and Maximize Formula Bar
Hiding and Unhiding Heading, Formula Bar, Gridlines from View Menu
Name box, where cell number is shown
Calculating manually by placing = and then clicking which cells are we trying to add, subtract, multiply, divide. e.g., =B2*C2
How to pull cells to automatically calculate rest of the values after calculating one
We can also perform Boolean operations or comparisons. e.g., =B2=B3 FALSE, =B2<B3 TRUE
Selecting the entire sheet by clicking the arrow at the top left corner of the sheet
Ctrl + Navigation button (up, left, bottom, right) takes us to the end of the sheet
Centering values in the cell through Home -> Alignment 
Vertical and Horizontal Scroll
Create multiple Sheets and navigating to them
Zoom in Zoom out, Font Size, Style etc etc
Status bar (Bottom left) shows Ready (ready to work), Enter (pressing enter will complete)

Creating new files, Saving files, Opening files manually and with Keyboard Shortcut (Ctrl + N, Ctrl + S, Ctrl + O)
Print the excel file

- Introduction (Cut, Copy, Paste, Format Painter, Clear All):

Copy, Cut, Paste using buttons from Home and using shortcuts (Ctrl + x | c | v)
After changing font or style or color of a cell element, we can select that cell and click Format Printer and then drag other cells to apply same font or style or color to them as well
When we copy or cut something then the Clipboard contains that value, we can simply take it use it later, we can click Paste All to paste all Clipboard elements at once

- Basic Navigation: 
Ribbons (The navigations on the top, can be hidden using Ctrl + F1)
Cells (Where we insert data)
Range (Selected cells area. e.g., A1:D1 (Horizontal), A1:A5 (Vertical), A1:D5 (Multiple selection))
Worksheets (Tabs of sheets of excel. e.g., | Sheet1 | Sheet2 | )

- Font Group (All Options):

Double clicking a column edge will automatically adjust it's size to show full texts, based on the elements it contains
Font size increase and decrease
Different Fonts and styles (Ctrl + B makes texts bold, same goes to Ctrl + U | I)
Click arrow beside Underline to choose Double Underline
Font and Cell Color change
Phone number's first 0 is not shown, so we start with ' and then type number to show the leading 0, but it will be considered String
Select a cell and press Del from keyboard to delete that cell element
Choosing Borders for a group of cells
When a cell contains number and it is resized to small, the number will be shown as Complex Number
Home -> Font -> Strikethrough then the text or number of the selected cell will be crossed in the middle
For Superscript or Subscript, select the value that will go up, then click Superscript or Superscript from Font box arrow
If dragging a cell doesn't give you a series of sequential elements, then click Fill Series
If date is not increasing like you want, try different sequence until it automatically makes the cell into date format
Use Paste Special to copy column and paste it as row
Draw Border Grid can help us easily draw a border around any range of cells

- Alignment, Wrap Text, Merge & Center:

Go to Paper Layout -> Page Setup -> Paper Size and choose appropriate paper size such as A4
Align your cell elements using the Home -> Alignment and choosing either of the given alignment
From Home, click the Orientation right above the Alignment and choose alignments such as Angle Clockwise or Angle Counterclockwise
On the left side of the Orientation, the Indents can be found. We can use it to move the elements inside the cell left or right little by little
On the Alignment section, we can also find the Merge & Align section, we  can use it to merge multiple cells
We can also use Increase Intends and Decrease Indent on merge cells, and based on the merge, they behave differently
You can also insert pictures of any size and resize into cells, you can also align pictures into anywhere inside the cell, you can even remove Background of the image 😱
If you want to keep the Cell Size and also fit texts inside the cell, then click Wrap Text in the Alignment section
You can set Margins to adjust the contents inside the page, go to Page Layout then Page Setup and adjust Margins

- Currency, Accounting, Currency VS Accounting:

From Home -> Number you can select Currency or Accounting format by changing General
By default the currency and Accounting is formatted as USD, but you can change it to other currencies
To remove the USD dollar sign, we can right click on the selected cell or cells, then go to Format Cells, and change the format to None
In Currency format, the -100 is represented as -100 but in Accounting format, -100 is represented as (100)
In Currency, 0 is represented as 0.00 and in Accounting, 0 is represented as -
We can also change Currency symbol to other Symbols like Taka
We can also set custom symbols such as TK instead of symbol from Right Click -> Format Cells -> Custom and then type 0.00 TK or 0.00 "TK"

- Short Date, Long Date, Date, Time, Date & Time:

If we insert a date into a cell and if it is left aligned, then the date format is not correct
If the date format is showing MM/DD/YY then we can fix it by opening Control Panel and then clicking Clock and Region then changing the format. This will automatically change the Excel date format too
Selecting one cell then clicking Ctrl + ; will automatically insert the current date in short form in the cell
In order to add time along with date in Date, we can use Ctrl + ; , Space , Ctrl + Shift + ;

- Percentage, Fraction, Scientific, Original Number:

We can change value type into Percentage in many ways such as from General, Clicking Format Cells, Clicking at the top most of a column and then Right Click then Format Cells etc
If we select Fraction type, then inserting any decimal value will automatically convert into Fraction
If more than one values of fraction (233/523) is not shown, then we can go to Format Cells and then select Up To Three Digits

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Highlight Cells Rules):

Select cells and press Conditional Formatting then Highlight Cells Rules and then choosing any of the operations and then set a value or select a cell containing value to show insights
To change the color of a condition, go to Select Color and then Custom then Fill
We can access More rules like Greater Than or Equals To from Conditional Formatting -> Highlight Cells -> More Rules
Blanks mean if there is any missing values or not

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Top and Botton Rules):

Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow from one cell will automatically select an entire column
We can easily sort an entire column using the Sort & Filter in Home menu on the right side of Auto Sum

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Data Bars & Color Scales):

In order to insert an entire row or rows, we have to click the most left row number, then right click and insert. We can pull the black dot to select more rows, and then inserting will add more rows as well. Same goes for column
We can use Data Bars to represent sum or other calculated values in a bar form, We can remove digits and only show bars, in order to do it we need to select the bars area then go to Conditional Formatting -> More Rules -> Edit Rules -> Only Bars
Different Color Scales represent different values, you can either choose red to indicate extreme value and green as normal value, or you can do the opposite
We can go to Conditional Formatting -> Manage Rules and modify rules as needed
We can also Change the range for which the color will change, for that we need to change the Type from Manage Rules -> Edit Rules into Number, then we can set values
We can do the same for Percent
We can also use Formula like =average(A1:A9)
Percent means “out of 100.”
→ Example: 75% = 75 out of 100.
Percentile tells you the position in a dataset.
→ Example: 75th percentile = you scored better than 75% of the group.
Percent = value
Percentile = rank

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Icon Sets, and New Rules):

Double cliking selected cells' + icon will automatically copy an entire column instead of just seleting an entire column manually by dragging the + icon to the bottom or top
We can select multiple rows or columns by pressing Ctrl + left click
We can change values for which the icons will be shown from Conditional Formatting -> Manage Rules -> Edit Rules and then changing Percent to Number, we can also change condition from <= to <
Select and entire table, then go to Conditional Formatting -> New Rule then press -> Use formula to determine which cell to format ten press = and select a cell that you want to use to find all information about that cells' row, then It would show something like this =$E$9, remove $ from 9 so that the column is locked but all rows are unlocked ($ unlocks rows or columns), after that click = and click a cell outside of the table, then click format and fill a color, after that if you type any item (of the column that you used to find its' row information) in that cell outside of the table it will color the row corrosponding to that value
We can also make a rule so that whenever any text value is inserted into a cell where a number should have been placed, then the cell or eells will change color, for that we need to select a cell and go to New Rule -> Use formula to determine which cell to format then click = and type istext() and select any cell that you want to check whther it is text or not and remove the $ from both row and column and then Fill with appropriate color, after applying that use format printer to apply same rules to other cells that you want this rule to be applied on, then if any of the selected cell has text then the color of that cel will change
We can type =istext() or =isnmber() and then click a cell to show TRUE or FAlSE in any other cell

- Styles Group (Format as Table):

Clicking the bottom right most cell of a table and ten pressing Tab from keyboard will automatically insert a row at the bottom
In order to get sum value of all rows in the last column, we have to select the last column, and then press Alt + = and the column will turn into Sum or Total Column
We can access many functionalities such as Filter from each column header down arrow
We can use Select All from filter to show everything and unckeck parts that we don't want to see
Ctrl + T will automatically convert the selected area as table

- Styles Group (Cells Styles):

We can modify a Cell Style by right cliking on the style and then click on Modify
In order to get commas within big numbers, we can select cells and then go to Cell Styles and click Commas right below the Number section
Comma[0] means there will be no decimal values
We can make a custom style by clicking New Cell Style -> Format -> Custom then choosing #,##0 and typing #,##0 "/-" then ok, after that Style 2 will be created, we can choose style 2 to see the results
Merge Styles is used to bring one worksheet styles into another

- Cells Group (Insert and Delete):
 
Insert Sheet Rows/Columns will add an entire row or column
Insert Sheet is used to add Sheets and same goes for the Delete Sheet

- Cells Group (Format Option):

You can manually Fit Columns or Rows according to their elements by selecting the area, then Cells -> Format -> AutoFit Row Hight or AutoFit Column Width
Or you can use shortcut such as Ctrl + A to select everything, then Alt + H O A for Row Hight, and Alt + H O I for Column Width
Or we can set size of rows hight and column width by clicking Cells -> Format -> Row Hight or Column Width
We can also Hide, Unhide Columns or Rows
We can select a a specific area of a sheet by clicking one Cell of that area and then Ctrl + A, This will only select the area instead of the entire sheet
We can rename sheets and change their order
Locked cells prevent editing when the sheet is protected.
Cells are locked by default so you can choose what to protect when applying Sheet Protection.
Lock only works after enabling Review > Protect Sheet or Cells > Format > Protect Sheet
Built a project using if and Lock feature

- Formulas & Functions (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, MAX, ROUND, and More Functions):

We can find sum multiple ways like selecting an area will show sum at the bottom most of the sheet, Another way is using AutoSum, then we can also use formula such as =SUM(E8:f4)
We can swap Columns or Rows by pressing Ctrl + X on the selected Row or Column, then click on the first cell of the place where you want to place the current Row or Column and then press Ctrl + Shift + =
ROUND(Cell or Value, number of digits) 
ROUND(E11, 0) Means non decimal round, Rounds to the nearest whole number, e.g., 10.3 > 10 and 10.7 > 11, if 10.5 > 11
ROUND(E11, 1 or any positive number) Means decimal round, Rounds the (1 or any positive number)th value to it's nearest whole number, e.g., ROUND(7.445, 1) > 7.4, ROUND(7.445) > 7.45
ROUND(E11, -1 or any negative number) Means tens, hundreds or more round, Rounds the (1 or any negative number) + 1th number from right most to it's nearest whole number based on the (1 or any negative number)th number, e.g., ROUND(123412, -1) > 123410, ROUND(123416, -1) > 123420, ROUND(123415, -2) > 123400
ROUNDUP(E11, 0 or Positive or Negative) Similar to ROUND() function but it only rounds to the next whole number, e.g., ROUNDUP(5.1, 0) > 6
ROUNDDOWN(E11, 0 or Positive or Negative) Opposite of ROUNDUP()
MROUND(E11, multiple) Rounds to the nearest Multiple, e.g., MROUND(12311, 4) > 12312 Means 12312 is the nearest to 12311 which can be devided by 4

- Fill Option (Up, Down, Left, Right, Across Worksheet):

Fill option has multiple elements such as Up, Down, Left Right (Ctrl + U or D or L or R), we use it to copy and paste a cell content to the selected area of cells
We can alternatively use the Auto Fill Options icon that appears after we select a series of cells, we can change it to Copy Cells
In order to access Across Worksheets, we need to select an area then while holding Ctrl we need to click the Sheet we want to use as destinition, then the Across Worksheet will be active, then we need to click Across Worksheet and we will find options such as All, Contents, Format, we can choose either of them to copy paste items across worksheets

- Fill Option (Fill Series and Justify):

If you have one cell containing a number and you want to create a series then choose an area Rowwise or Columnwise then go to Fill > Series then choose either Rows or Columns based on your need and then set a number range if desired and press ok
Alternatively you can use shortcut Alt + E + I + S then Enter
If you want to move a column or row to another place without using copy paste, then Select the Column or Row, then Hover the mouse until a Move icon shows up, then Click while Holding Shift and move it to whereever needed
Linear increases additionally, Growth increases multiplically, WorkDay means all the Working Days excluding the Off Days, 
Normal Fill = repeats or continues a simple pattern
Trend Fill = fits a mathematical trend line (more intelligent)
When we have a big sentence that does not fit into a cell by default then we can use Justify to break that sentence into words and insert those words below cells one by one, It will break the sentence based on the Cell size

- Clear Option (Clear All, Clear Formats, Clear Contents, Clear Comments):

We can add comments on cells by right clicking on a cell and pressing Insert Comment
We can also reshape the Comment Box, Hide, Unhide it
Clear Formats/Contents/Comments/Hyperlinks removes specific part of the selected area but Clear All removes everything
Clear Hyperlinks removes only hyperlinks while Remove Hyperlinks removes both hyperlinks and formatting (underline, blue color)

- Editing Group (Sorting):

In order to generate random series you can use the formula =ROUND(Value1, (Value2 - Value1) * RAND(), 2) , this will generate random numbers between Value1 and Value2
1. RAND()
Returns a random decimal number between 0 and 1.
Example output: 0.2438, 0.8793, etc.
2. (b - a)
This is the range or width of the interval.
For example, if a = 5 and b = 10, then (b - a) = 5.
3. (b - a) * RAND()
Scales the random number into your desired range.
Now you get a random decimal between 0 and (b - a).
Example: If RAND() = 0.3, and (b - a) = 5, then this part is 1.5.
4. a + ...
This shifts the number up to start at a.
So you now get a number between a and b.
Example: a = 5, so 5 + 1.5 = 6.5
5. ROUND(..., 2)
Rounds the final result to 2 decimal places.
We can also use =RANDBETWEEN(Value1, Value2), it will generate random numbers between Value1 and Value2
We can also sort color wise, for that, go to Sort & Filter > Custom Sort and select Sort on to Color, then we can choose Order color and Ascending or Descending, after that we can Add Level and order the color based on our need
We can use the Up and Down buttons to move a selected Cell upward or downward
We can also do the same for Cell Icons
We can customize the order by selecting Custom List and listing the values as we desire
We can also save the custom order by clicking the Add button
We can sort multiple columns by selecting them and then choosing Custom sort and adding levels for each column
If we select an area where a blank cell exists, then sorting will place that blank cell at the most bottom
We can select a single cell of a column and click sort and the entire column will be sorted
If we want to sort a single column of an area where all the columns are connected, then an warning messege will pop and give us two options, where if we choose Expand the selection then the entire area will change with the sort, but If we choose Continue with current selection then the connection will not be represented properly
Selecting an entire area and then custom sorting only one column will change others accordingly

- Editing Group (Custom Sort):

If our columns are not placed sequentially like Name ID Income Age, then we can custom sort it and fix their positions, in order to do that we need to mark 1 to n (number of columns) to each column based on which position what column should be in ascending order, we should mark each cell by placing 1 to n on their immidiate above cell, then we should select the area with those marked cells above, after that we click Custom sort > Options > Sort left to right, and then we should select Sort by as the initial row number
We can do the same thing for Top to bottom

- Editing Group (Filter):

Ctrl + Shift + L turn Auto Filters to selected area, you may see dropdown icon appear, but that does not mean that the area is converted into a table, it shows up because of AutoFilters, in order to convert a selected area into table, use Ctrl + T
AND = Both condition must be true
OR = Either one can be true or both
Once we apply filter to a selected area and then make any change in any cell or rows of the selected cell, then the Reapply option becomes accessible, by clicking Reapply button, we can reapply all the filters to the changed cells or rows and the cells or rows of the selected area will change 

- Editing Group (Find & Replace):

Ctrl + F is the shortcut for Find and Replace
From Options << we can find Match case, which will only show targets that matches exactly, and becomes case sensitive
Match entire cell contents will only show targets that matches only search portion, cells containing additional contents will not be shown, it is not case sensitive
If we select Within Workbook, then all targets accross all sheets will be shown
By rows mean the search will show next results row by row if the target is present in the same row, and then to the next column
By columns mean the opposite
If we select Lock in as Comments, and write something for example Good Boy in the Find what box, then the result will show all comments containing Good Boy
Ctrl + H will redirect you to the Find and Replace > Replace 
If we want to replace formats accross cells then, click Format box of Find what and select Choose format from cells and click which cell you want as target, then click the Format box of Replace with, then you can either manually select a format or you can Choose format from other cells

- Editing Group (Find & Select (Go to & Go to Special)):

Ctrl + G is the shortcut for Go To section
Fn + F5 is an alternative shortcut
Go to is used to go to any specific cell
Constants mean cells that does not have any formula, or general data
=CONCATENATE(E11, " ", D11) is used to concatenate two strings and create a new strings, in this case cell E11 and D11 are combined with a space " " to create a new string
Current region will select an area if the current selected cell belongs to one area, if not, then only the cell will be shown
Array is used to perform calculations with multiple cells at once, in traditional ways we apply a formula and drag down the formula to generate other results with same formula, but in array, when we apply a formula, it automatically applies the formula to other selected cells as well
regular formulas as scalar operations: they take one (or a few) inputs and give you one output in a single cell. An array formula lets you work with whole sets of inputs at once, and — depending on the function — can return multiple outputs (spill into many cells) or feed a multi‑step calculation in one shot.
In order to use array, we must use Ctrl + Shift + Enter in a cell to activate array to that cell
e.g., We cannot do this normally =AVERAGE(C30:C45 - D30:D45), but by clicking Ctrl + Shift + Enter we can make it array and do this task
WordArt, images, shapes, emojis are Objects
Row difference and Column difference show non similar or unequal values within an area row by row or column by column
Precedents and Dependents are like Independent and Dependent variables, Independents are those which leads to a calculation of other value, while dependents are the result that is derived from independents
Ctrl + [ is the shortcut to find Precedent
We can show tracking of Precedents by clicking Formulas > Trace precedents, then an arrow will show navigation fo how the precedents leads to a result
Ctrl + ] is the shortcut for showing dependents
Precedent -> What cells affect the value of the current or selected cell
Dependent -> What cells are affected by the value of the current or selected cell
If we select an entire column by clicking at the top and then press Ctrl + Shift + -> or <- then all of the cells including the selected column's cells will be selected in arrow's direction, then we can fill them with white color to make the cells disappear
We can do the same with row by selecting a row as well
Ctrl + end will take you to the last cell 
Ctrl + home will take you to the first cell 
If we hide some rows or columns and then copy the area and paste it in other sheets or files, then the hidden cells will also be pasted, in order to prevent that after we hide some cells or rows or columns, then we select the area and Go to special > Visible cells only then copy the area and paste it somewhere else, then the hidden cells will not be pasted
We can use the shortcut Alt + ; to select Visible cells only
Conditional formatting shows us where in the entire file Conditional formatting is applied

- Data Validation (Any value and Whole number):

If we choose a data validation from Data > Data Validation which is in the Data Tools section, then change Allow from Any value to other such as Whole number then the selected cells will only allow you to fill whole numbers only, if you try anything else, it will show an error
We can also custom set an input message from Data > Data Validation > Input Message to show when the user is entering an input
The input message pop up box can be dragged to some other place if bothering
We can also select the Error Alert from Data > Data Validation > Style as Stop (Does not allow the user to continue), Warning (The user is shown a warning message but still can continue), Information (Similar to warning message)
If we choose either Information or Warning and enter an invalid data then we can spot them by clicking Data Validation > Circle Invalid Data and all the invalid data will be circled
We can clear the circles by clicking Data Validation > Clear Validation Circles
After writing something in a cell and presseing Enter will move to the bottom cell, but pressing Shift + Enter will move to the above cell
Instead of manually typing values in cells, we can use Dropdown list that adds a dropdown arrow attached to cells from which we can select pre defined values
In order to do that we need to select the area then Data Validation, then select List in Allow section, and type which options or values you want to show in the list in source section
We can also do another thing, we can list whichever contents that we want to use in the list in somewhere in the sheet, and instead of typing the options or values in the Source section we can select those cells where the elements are 
If you add a new option or value in that reference list, then the value will not be shown in the dropdown, so you have to move the new option or value using Shift + Drag to the middle of that list
We can also change order by moving or replacing cells within the reference list
We can also use reference list from other sheets as well
Text length means what will be the length of the text that we will put in every cell, suppose we write Hello in a cell, so if we set the text length to 5 then it will allow hello to be inserted, but if we add one more letter then it will show error, Note that space is also counted as letter
For allowing only unique values remember this:
1. Formula Pattern
   =COUNTIF(<lookup_range>, <this_cell>) = 1
   • Returns TRUE if the value in <this_cell> appears exactly once in <lookup_range>.

2. Locking the Lookup Range
   • Fixed block (e.g. rows 10–17 in column K):
     =COUNTIF($K$10:$K$17, K10)=1
     – $K$10:$K$17 stays the same when you copy down.
     – K10 (no $) changes to K11, K12, etc.

   • Entire column:
     =COUNTIF($K:$K, K10)=1
     – $K:$K always means the whole column K.
     – Good for growing lists; slower on very large sheets; counts blanks too.

3. Criterion Cell Reference
   • Relative row (K10): adjusts to each row.
   • Absolute row ($K$10): always tests cell K10.

4. “$” Cheat‑Sheet
   • $ before column (e.g. $K) locks column.
   • $ before row (e.g. K$10) locks row.
   • $K$10 locks both column and row (single cell).
   • $K:$K locks entire column K.
   • $K$10:$K$17 locks that exact block.

CountIF function:

Quick Guide to COUNTIF in Excel

1. Function Structure  
   COUNTIF(range, criteria)  
   • Counts how many cells in range meet the given criteria.

2. Parameters  
   • range: the block of cells to check (e.g. A1:A100, K:K)  
   • criteria: condition each cell is tested against (number, expression, text, wildcard, or cell reference)

3. Types of Criteria  
   • Number  
     – COUNTIF(A1:A10, 5)  
       Counts cells exactly equal to 5.  
   • Expression (comparison)  
     – COUNTIF(B1:B20, “>100”)  
       Counts cells with values greater than 100.  
     – Operators: =, <>, >, <, >=, <= (always in quotes)  
   • Text  
     – COUNTIF(C1:C50, “Apple”)  
       Counts cells exactly matching “Apple” (case‑insensitive).  
   • Wildcards  
     – `*` matches any sequence of characters  
       • COUNTIF(NameRange, "East*") finds “East”, “Eastern Campus”, etc.  
       • COUNTIF(NameRange, "*son") finds “Johnson”, “Anderson”, etc.  
     – `?` matches exactly one character  
       • COUNTIF(CodeRange, "A?3") finds “AB3”, “A63” but not “A123”.  
       • COUNTIF(WordRange, "?at") finds “Cat”, “Bat” but not “That”.  
   • Cell reference  
     – COUNTIF(F1:F50, G1)  
       Counts cells equal to the value in G1.  
   • Expression with reference  
     – COUNTIF(F1:F50, “>” & G1)  
       Counts cells greater than the value in G1.  
   • Dates  
     – COUNTIF(H1:H100, “>” & DATE(2025,1,1))  
       Counts dates after Jan 1, 2025.  
     – Can also reference a cell: “>” & A1 where A1 holds a date.

4. Special Behaviors  
   • Blanks vs. non‑blanks  
     – COUNTIF(A1:A10, “”) counts empty cells.  
     – COUNTIF(A1:A10, “<>”) counts cells that are not empty.  
   • Mixed data types  
     – Numbers in quotes (e.g. “5”) are treated as text, not numeric.  
   • Logical values and errors  
     – COUNTIF will ignore TRUE, FALSE, and error values unless they match the criteria exactly.  
   • Whole‑column ranges (e.g. K:K)  
     – Scans all 1,048,576 rows; includes blank cells in the count.  
     – Use with care on very large sheets (performance).

5. Common Uses  
   • Count specific status  
     – COUNTIF(StatusRange, “Completed”)  
   • Count above/below thresholds  
     – COUNTIF(ScoreRange, “>=80”)  
     – COUNTIF(ScoreRange, “<50”)  
   • Partial text matching  
     – COUNTIF(NameRange, “Mc*”) finds names starting with “Mc”.  
   • Compare to another cell  
     – COUNTIF(DateRange, “<” & DeadlineCell)  
   • Unique‑value test  
     – COUNTIF($K:$K, K10)=1 returns TRUE if K10 is unique in column K.

6. Locking References  
   • $A$1:$A$10 locks both column & row (never shifts)  
   • A$1 locks row only (column shifts when copying across)  
   • $A1 locks column only (row shifts when copying down)  
   • $K:$K locks entire column K  
   • $K$10:$K$17 locks block K10–K17  

7. Relative vs. Absolute Ranges  
   • Relative range (K10:K17) will “drift” when copied down (→ K11:K18, K12:K19, etc.)  
   • Use absolute ranges ($K$10:$K$17 or $K:$K) to keep the lookup area fixed  

8. Multiple Criteria  
   • Use COUNTIFS for AND logic:  
     COUNTIFS(Range1, Criteria1, Range2, Criteria2, …)  
   • For OR logic, combine multiple COUNTIFs or use SUMPRODUCT

9. Tips  
   • Always enclose operators (>, <, <>) in quotes and concatenate with & for cell refs.  
   • Use wildcards (*, ?) for flexible text matches.  
   • When testing uniqueness, include a non‑blank check:  
     =AND(K10<>"", COUNTIF($K:$K, K10)=1)  
   • Keep ranges tight (avoid entire columns) for better performance.  

We can use =ISODD(any cell of the selected area) to allow only odd values across the selected area
Same goes for =ISEVEN()
Similarly =ISTEXT(any cell of the selected area) can be used to only allow texts
Same goes for =ISNUMBER()

Quick Guide: Introduction to Pivot Tables in Excel

1. What Is a Pivot Table?  
   • An interactive summary tool that automatically aggregates, analyzes, and presents large data sets.  
   • Lets you “pivot” (re‑arrange) rows and columns to see different perspectives.

2. When to Use Pivot Tables  
   • You have a detailed table of records (e.g., sales transactions, survey responses).  
   • You need quick totals, averages, counts, or subgroup analyses by category.  
   • You want an easy drag‑and‑drop interface instead of complex formulas.

3. Basic Components  
   • **Rows area**: Fields you want listed down the side (e.g., Salesman, District).  
   • **Columns area**: Fields you want across the top (e.g., Month, Item).  
   • **Values area**: Numeric fields to summarize (e.g., Sales TK) — default is “Sum,” can change to “Count,” “Average,” etc.  
   • **Filters area**: Fields to filter the entire report (e.g., Year, Region).

4. Creating a Pivot Table  
   1. Select any cell in your data table.  
   2. Go to **Insert → PivotTable**.  
   3. Choose where to place it (new worksheet or existing).  
   4. Click **OK**.

5. Building the Layout  
   • Drag fields from the Field List into Rows, Columns, Values, and Filters.  
   • Rearrange fields to change the view.  
   • Right‑click a Value and choose **Value Field Settings** to switch from Sum to Count, Average, Min, Max, etc.

6. Common Analyses  
   • **Total sales by salesman**: Rows = Salesman; Values = Sum of Sales TK.  
   • **Sales by month and district**: Rows = Month; Columns = District; Values = Sum of Sales TK.  
   • **Count of transactions by item**: Rows = Item; Values = Count of Item.

7. Tips & Tricks  
   • **Refresh** after data changes: Right‑click PivotTable → Refresh.  
   • **Group dates**: Right‑click a Date/Month field → Group → choose Years, Quarters, Months.  
   • **Show % of total**: Value Field Settings → Show Values As → % of Grand Total or % of Row/Column Total.  
   • **PivotChart**: Click inside PivotTable → PivotChart for dynamic charts.  
   • **Slicers** (Excel 2010+): Insert → Slicer to add clickable filters.

8. Keep in Mind  
   • Source data should have no blank header names and no completely blank rows/columns.  
   • Use an Excel Table (Insert → Table) as your source to allow dynamic range growth.  
   • PivotTables do not automatically update when you add new columns—refresh and ensure the source range covers them.

Keep this cheat‑sheet handy next time you need to slice and dice your data in seconds!

   • Always set **Alt Text** for accessibility and clear documentation.

Keep this guide handy to tweak your PivotTable’s behavior, appearance, and performance—without hunting through every menu each time!

PivotTable Options – Layout & Format

1. Accessing the Dialog  
   • Right‑click inside the PivotTable → PivotTable Options… → Layout & Format tab  
   • Or Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Options → Layout & Format

2. Layout Settings  
   • Autofit column widths on update  
     – When checked, Excel resizes PivotTable columns to fit new data when you Refresh.  
     – Uncheck to preserve your manual column widths.  
   • Preserve cell formatting on update  
     – Keeps any custom fonts, colors, number formats, or cell borders you apply—even after Refresh.  
   • Merge and center cells with labels  
     – Combines identical item labels into one merged cell for a cleaner look.  
     – Unmerge to show each row label in its own cell.  
   • Display field captions and filter drop‑downs  
     – Toggles the header row with field names and the little filter arrows on/off.  
   • For empty cells show: ___  
     – Enter text (e.g. “0” or “N/A”) to display instead of a blank.  
   • Display error values as: ___  
     – Replace error codes (#DIV/0!, #N/A, etc.) with custom text.  
   • Show items with no data on rows/columns  
     – Include items that exist in the field’s source but have no matching records in the current filter context.  
   • Classic PivotTable layout (enables dragging fields in grid)  
     – Switches to pre‑2007 layout where you can place and move fields directly inside the table grid rather than in the Field List.  
   • Enable show details  
     – Allows you to double‑click a summary value cell to see the underlying source rows in a new sheet.

3. Format Settings  
   • Autofit row heights on update  
     – (If available) Resizes row height to fit wrapped text when refreshing.  
   • Preserve formatting of number cells  
     – Keeps your numeric formatting (currency, percentages, decimals) intact on refresh.  
   • Use built‑in PivotTable style  
     – Choose or change the overall style (banded rows/columns, header colors) from the Design tab rather than custom formatting.

PivotTable Options – Totals & Filters

1. Accessing PivotTable Options  
   • Right‑click anywhere in the PivotTable → PivotTable Options…  
   • Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Options (leftmost button)  

2. Totals & Filters Tab (in PivotTable Options dialog)  
   This tab controls how subtotals and grand totals behave, and how filters are applied.

   A. Subtotals  
      • Do “Automatic” subtotals: Excel applies the default (SUM) subtotal under each group.  
      • Do “None”: turn off all subtotals.  
      • Do “Custom...”: choose which fields show subtotals and pick functions (SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, etc.).  

   B. Grand Totals  
      • For Rows and Columns:  
         – Show grand totals for rows only  
         – Show grand totals for columns only  
         – Show grand totals for both  
         – Off for both (no grand totals anywhere)  

   C. Filters  
      • “Allow multiple filters per field”  
         – Enables you to apply more than one Label or Value filter to the same field.  
      • “Merge and center cells with labels”  
         – When filtering hides items, this option merges remaining label cells for visual clarity.  

3. Field‑Level Totals & Filters (Ribbon / Field Settings)  
   For each Row or Column field you can override global settings:

   A. Subtotals & Filters in Field Settings  
      1. Right‑click a field name in the Row/Column area → Field Settings…  
      2. Subtotals & Filters tab allows:  
         – Subtotal options: Automatic, None, or Custom Function list  
         – Filter options:  
             • Label Filters (e.g. Begins With, Does Not Equal)  
             • Value Filters (e.g. Top 10 Items, Greater Than)  

   B. Changing Subtotal Function  
      • In Custom Subtotals: select one or more functions (Sum, Count, Average, Max, Min, etc.).  

4. Using Report Filters vs. Slicers  
   • Report Filter area (Filter Field):  
     – Drag a field into the “Filters” box in the Field List.  
     – Displays above the PivotTable as a dropdown—select one or multiple items.  
   • Slicers (Excel 2010+):  
     – Insert → Slicer after selecting PivotTable.  
     – Visual, clickable buttons; can format color and style.  

5. Label & Value Filters (Row/Column Fields)  
   • Label Filters (text fields in Row/Column):  
     – Equals, Does Not Equal, Begins With, Ends With, Contains, Does Not Contain, Greater Than, Less Than (lexical).  
   • Value Filters (numeric fields in Row/Column):  
     – Top 10, Above/Below Average, Greater Than, Less Than, Between, Equals, Does Not Equal.

6. Turning Off Filters & Totals Quickly (Design Tab)  
   • Design → Subtotals  
     – Do Not Show Subtotals / Show All Subtotals at Top/Bottom of Group  
   • Design → Grand Totals  
     – On for Rows and Columns / On for Rows Only / On for Columns Only / Off for Rows and Columns  
   • Design → Report Layout  
     – Show in Tabular Form (forces subtotals below; better for viewing)  
     – Show in Outline Form  
     – Show in Compact Form (default)  

7. Best Practices & Tips  
   • Disable unnecessary subtotals/grand totals to reduce clutter if you only need a specific summary.  
   • Use Custom Subtotals sparingly—too many functions slow recalculation.  
   • Use “Allow multiple filters per field” to refine multi‑layered filters without removing prior criteria.  
   • Remember to Refresh after changing options or source data (PivotTable Analyze → Refresh).  
   • Combine Report Filters with Slicers for interactive dashboards.  
   • Lock the PivotTable position (Options → Layout & Format → Enable/Disable “Autofit column widths on update”) to keep your report layout stable.

PivotTable Options – Display

1. Accessing the Display Tab  
   • Right‑click inside the PivotTable → PivotTable Options… → Display  
   • Or on the Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Options → Display

2. Show Expand/Collapse Buttons  
   • Toggles the little “+” and “–” icons next to grouped items.  
   • When ON you can click to drill into or collapse details right in the report.  
   • When OFF all items remain expanded or collapsed as last set, and no icons appear.

3. Display Field Captions & Filter Drop‑Downs  
   • Controls the header row above your PivotTable.  
   • ON: shows each field name with its funnel icon for filtering.  
   • OFF: hides headers and arrows for a cleaner look—use only when no further filtering is needed.

4. Display Context Tooltips  
   • When hovering over a value cell, a small popup shows the field path (e.g., “Region > Month > Sales”).  
   • Helps you confirm which row/column fields and items produced that number.  
   • Turn OFF to reduce on‑screen clutter if you’re already familiar with your layout.

5. Show Properties in Tooltip  
   • Extends the context tooltip to include item metadata (like source cell, record count, custom properties).  
   • Useful when you’ve attached additional attributes to items via OLAP or Data Model fields.  
   • OFF for simpler tooltips showing only field/item names.

6. Show Drilled‑Down Items  
   • Controls whether double‑clicking a summary cell automatically creates a new sheet with all underlying detail rows.  
   • ON: double‑click opens “show details” sheet.  
   • OFF: double‑click does nothing—prevents accidental drill into very large tables.

7. Show Context Menu  
   • ON: right‑clicking a PivotTable cell shows the full PivotTable context menu (refresh, field settings, group, etc.).  
   • OFF: limits right‐click to standard cell menu—locks the PivotTable structure.

8. Show Filter Fields per Column/Row  
   • When using multiple row or column fields, this ensures each field has its own filter arrow in the header.  
   • OFF can tidy up space by showing only the top‐level field’s arrow.

9. Practical Tips  
   • Disable expand/collapse icons if your audience may be confused by them.  
   • Hide captions and drop‑downs in a finalized report to prevent accidental changes.  
   • Use context tooltips during design; turn them off in a published dashboard for a cleaner look.  
   • Lock down “drill‑down” if your source data is huge to avoid massive new sheets.  

PivotTable Options – Printing

1. Accessing the Printing Tab  
   • Right‑click inside the PivotTable → PivotTable Options… → Printing  
   • Or on the Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Options → Printing

2. Print Row and Column Headers  
   • ON: repeats row labels on each printed page so you always know which category each row belongs to.  
   • OFF: prints labels only where they first appear (default Excel behavior).

3. Repeat Row Labels  
   • ON: prints the row field’s item label on every single row, not just the first row of each group.  
     – Useful when exporting to reports or PDFs so each line is self‑contained.  
   • OFF: shows the label only at the start of each grouped section.

4. Print Filter Fields  
   • ON: includes any Report Filter fields (and their selections) at the top of each printed page.  
     – Helps readers know which filters were applied when viewing printed reports.  
   • OFF: omits filter settings from the printout.

5. Print Page Field Labels  
   • ON: prints the names of page (report) filter fields above the PivotTable.  
   • OFF: suppresses these headings to save space.

6. Page Break Options  
   • Automatic Page Breaks  
     – Excel inserts page breaks based on your current page size, margins, and PivotTable layout.  
   • Manual Page Breaks  
     – You can insert your own breaks: Page Layout → Breaks → Insert Page Break.  
   • Keep Page Breaks  
     – ON: preserves manual breaks even after refreshing or changing the PivotTable layout.  
     – OFF: Excel may move or remove manual breaks on update.

7. Fit to Page Settings  
   • Adjust in Page Layout → Scale to Fit:  
     – Width/Page(s): fit the PivotTable to a set number of pages wide.  
     – Height/Page(s): fit to a set number of pages tall.  
   • Useful when printing wide PivotTables.

8. Print Gridlines and Headings  
   • In Excel’s Page Layout tab (not in Pivot Options), you can choose to print cell gridlines and row/column headings.  
   • TIP: Toggle these on for more spreadsheet‑like appearance, or off for a cleaner look.

9. Practical Tips  
   • Preview before printing: File → Print to check pagination.  
   • Use “Repeat Row Labels” in tabular form reports so each line shows its category.  
   • Include filter settings on printed pages when sharing with stakeholders.  
   • Lock manual page breaks if your report layout is final.  
   • Combine with “Autofit column widths” (Layout & Format tab) for best print fitting.

PivotTable Options – Data

1. Accessing the Data Tab  
   • Right‑click inside the PivotTable → PivotTable Options… → Data  
   • Or on the Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Options → Data

2. Refresh Control  
   • “Refresh data when opening the file”  
     – ON: PivotTable automatically updates from its source each time you open the workbook.  
     – OFF: Requires manual Refresh (PivotTable Analyze → Refresh or right‑click → Refresh).

3. Background Refresh (for external connections)  
   • ON: Allows Excel to refresh the PivotTable’s external data in the background so you can continue working.  
   • OFF: Excel waits until the refresh completes before you can do anything else.

4. Save Source Data with File  
   • ON: Embeds a copy of all the PivotTable’s source records in the workbook.  
     – Enables offline “Show Details” drilling even if the original data isn’t available.  
     – Increases file size.  
   • OFF: Doesn’t store source data—drill‑down only works if the source is accessible.

5. Number of Items to Retain per Field  
   • Determines how many distinct item names Excel caches for each field.  
     – Automatic: keeps old items even if they’re filtered out, useful for consistent pivot layout.  
     – None: drops all unused items from the cache, reduces file size but loses old items.  
     – Max: specify a custom number of items to retain.  
   • Use None or a low Max to minimize file size when your source constantly changes.

6. Enable Drill‑Down (“Show Details”)  
   • Controls whether double‑clicking a summary cell reveals its underlying records in a new sheet.  
   • If you stored source data with the file, drill‑down works offline.  
   • Disable if you want to prevent accidental generation of large detail sheets.

7. PivotTable Data Source  
   • Button to view or change the source range, table, or OLAP/PowerPivot connection.  
   • Ensures your PivotTable is pointing at the correct cells, table, or external data model.

8. Retain Formatting and Sorting on Update  
   • Optionally keep number formats, cell styles, and manual sort orders intact when the pivot refreshes.  
   • Uncheck to reset formatting and sorting to default each time you refresh.

9. Practical Tips  
   • Turn ON “Refresh when opening” for dashboards that must always show current data.  
   • Use Background Refresh with large external queries to avoid UI freezes.  
   • Save source data only if you need offline drill‑down—otherwise, turn it OFF for smaller file size.  
   • Choose “None” for items to retain if your fields have high cardinality (many unique values).  
   • Regularly review and clear old cache items (PivotTable Analyze → Options → Data → Clear Old Items).

PivotTable Tools – Group

1. Accessing the Group Feature  
   • Select one or more items in a Row or Column area of the PivotTable.  
   • Right‑click → Group…  
   • Or on the Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze → Group Field (in the Active Field group)

2. Manual Grouping of Items  
   • Select multiple contiguous items (e.g. “East”, “North”).  
   • Group… creates a new “Group1” field containing just those items.  
   • Rename the group in the PivotTable Fields list to something meaningful (e.g. “Regions A”).  
   • You can group existing groups again for nested hierarchy.

3. Date/Time Grouping  
   • Select a single date field in Rows or Columns.  
   • Group… opens options for:  
     – **By Months, Quarters, Years, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds**  
     – Check multiple levels for multi‑level grouping (Year + Quarter + Month).  
   • Click OK to insert each grouping level as its own field.  
   • Use the +/– icons to expand or collapse date hierarchy.

4. Numeric Grouping  
   • Select one or more numeric items (e.g. ages, sales values) or the entire numeric field.  
   • Group… lets you define:  
     – **Starting at:** the minimum number in your groups  
     – **Ending at:** the maximum number  
     – **By:** interval size (e.g. group ages by 10 → 0–9, 10–19, etc.)  
   • Excel builds bins of equal width; you can rename the bin labels.

5. Ungrouping  
   • To remove a group:  
     – Select any item in that group → Right‑click → Ungroup  
   • For date/numeric groups, Ungroup restores the original field.  
   • For manual groups, Ungroup deletes the group field entirely.

6. Group Settings & Options  
   • In the Group dialog you can:  
     – Adjust Start, End, and By values for numeric bins.  
     – Check “By” units for date groupings.  
   • After grouping, fields appear under the original field in the Field List; you can reorder or remove them.  
   • To rename a group (for clarity), select the group name in the Row/Column labels, press F2, and type a new label.

7. Multiple Group Levels  
   • You can apply numeric or date grouping on top of manual grouping for multi‑layer analysis.  
   • Drill‑down with expand/collapse buttons to move through levels.

8. Best Practices & Tips  
   • Always sort your source data chronologically or numerically before grouping to avoid unexpected bin boundaries.  
   • Use meaningful group names—double‑click the default “Group1” in Row labels to rename.  
   • Limit bin sizes to useful ranges; too many tiny bins clutter the report.  
   • Remember to Refresh the PivotTable after changing source data; grouped fields retain settings.  
   • Use Ungroup when you need to adjust group definitions—then reapply grouping with new parameters.

PivotTable Tools – Sort

1. Accessing Sort Controls  
   • Click the drop‑down arrow next to any Row or Column label in your PivotTable.  
   • Or on the Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze → Sort (in the Active Field group) → Sort A to Z / Z to A / More Sort Options.

2. Sort by Label (Item Name)  
   • **Ascending (A → Z)**: orders items alphabetically or numerically low → high.  
   • **Descending (Z → A)**: orders items reverse alphabetical or high → low.  
   • Applies to the selected field only; other fields remain in their current order.

3. Sort by Value  
   • In the drop‑down arrow choose **More Sort Options…**  
     – Select **“Sort by Value”** instead of by item name.  
     – Choose the **Summary Value** (Sum of Sales, Count of Records, etc.).  
     – Pick Ascending or Descending.  
   • Useful for ranking items by total sales, counts, averages, etc., rather than name.

4. Manual Drag‑and‑Drop Sorting  
   • In **Classic PivotTable layout** (Layout & Format → Classic Layout), you can drag Row labels up or down to any order.  
   • Or in the Field List under Rows/Columns, drag items within a field to reorder them manually.

5. Custom List Sorting  
   • Excel custom lists let you sort by a preset order (e.g. Jan, Feb, Mar… or High, Medium, Low).  
   • Go to PivotTable Analyze → Sort → More Sort Options → More Options → **“Use custom lists when sorting”**.  
   • Ensure your custom list is defined in File → Options → Advanced → Edit Custom Lists.

6. Sorting Multiple Fields  
   • If you have nested Row fields, sort the **top field** first, then sort each **sub‑field** individually.  
   • Use the drop‑down on each field’s label to set its own sort order.

7. Sort Options Dialog  
   • **More Sort Options…** from the label drop‑down opens the dialog:  
     – Specify **Sort type**: Manual, Ascending by label, or Descending by value.  
     – Click **More Options…** to sort items with no data at the bottom, or to sort left‑to‑right for column fields.

8. Persistent Sorting on Refresh  
   • In PivotTable Options → Layout & Format, uncheck **“Autofit column widths on update”** to keep manual widths.  
   • In PivotTable Options → Data, set **“Number of items to retain per field”** to avoid reintroducing old items that could disrupt sort.

9. Best Practices & Tips  
   • Always sort the **highest‑level** field first to establish overall order.  
   • Use **Value sort** for ranking rather than alphabetical label sort.  
   • Combine **custom lists** with manual groups for industry‑specific orders.  
   • Refresh after changing source data but verify sort order remains correct—reapply if needed.  
   • For large pivot tables, avoid too many manual reorders; use custom lists or value sorts for consistency.

PivotTable Tools – Data Group

1. Where to Find It  
   • Click anywhere in your PivotTable → Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Data group (middle of the tab)  

2. Refresh  
   • **Refresh** (single icon)  
     – Updates the active PivotTable from its current source (re‑reads any changed cell values in the source range or table).  
     – Shortcut: Select the PivotTable and press Alt + F5.  
   • **Refresh All**  
     – Updates every PivotTable and data connection in the entire workbook.  
     – Shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + F5.  

3. Change Data Source  
   • Opens the dialog to redefine the PivotTable’s source:  
     – Switch from a static range (e.g. A1:D100) to an Excel Table (dynamic) or vice versa.  
     – Expand or shrink the range if your data size has changed.  
     – Change connection string if you’re using an external data model/OLAP source.  
   • Best Practice: Use an Excel Table (Insert → Table) so the Pivot auto‐expands when you add rows.

4. Connections (Existing Connections)  
   • Opens the **Workbook Connections** dialog:  
     – Lists all external data sources (databases, OLAP, OData feeds) and data model queries.  
     – Allows you to **Add**, **Remove**, or **Edit** connection properties (e.g. authentication, command text).  
     – Control background refresh and caching options per connection.  

5. Data Source Settings (for Data Model / Power Pivot)  
   • If your Pivot uses the Data Model, click **Data Source Settings** under Connections:  
     – Manage which tables and relationships feed the model.  
     – Change Privacy Levels, Command Timeout, or Fast Data Load options.  

6. Clear  
   • While in many versions Clear lives under its own group, sometimes it’s included here:  
     – **Clear Filters**: removes all report‐level & field filters.  
     – **Clear All**: resets the PivotTable layout and filters back to blank.  

7. Select  
   • Again, occasionally grouped here—enables quick selection of:  
     – **Entire PivotTable**  
     – **Labels** only  
     – **Values** only  
   • Useful before copying, formatting, or clearing parts of the PivotTable.

8. Practical Tips  
   • **Always Refresh** after changing source data. If you skip this, the Pivot won’t reflect updates.  
   • Use **Refresh All** when you have multiple Pivots or external queries.  
   • **Change Data Source** before adding new fields—prevents orphaned or misaligned data.  
   • Review **Connections** to disable unused queries and improve workbook performance.  
   • Convert raw data ranges to Tables to let your Pivot automatically grow without manual “Change Data Source.”

PivotTable Tools – Actions Group

1. Location  
   • On the Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze (or Options) → Actions group (usually left side)

2. Field List  
   • Toggles the PivotTable Field List pane on/off.  
   • Field List shows available fields and layout areas (Filters, Columns, Rows, Values).  
   • Shortcut: Alt + J + T + I (in sequence on Windows).

3. Expand/Collapse Field  
   • **Expand Field**  
     – Adds “+” buttons next to items in a selected row/column field, showing nested detail.  
     – Right‑click an item → Expand/Collapse → Expand Entire Field to open all items.  
   • **Collapse Field**  
     – Hides lower-level details under a collapsed item (“–” button).  
     – Right‑click an item → Expand/Collapse → Collapse Entire Field.

4. Clear  
   • **Clear All**  
     – Removes all fields from Filters, Rows, Columns, and Values—resets the PivotTable blank.  
   • **Clear Filters**  
     – Clears only any applied filters on the selected field or the entire report.  
   • Shortcut: Right‑click a field label → Remove Field.

5. Select  
   • **Entire PivotTable**  
     – Highlights the full PivotTable region; useful before formatting or copying.  
   • **Labels**  
     – Selects just the row and column headers (item labels) for quick formatting.  
   • **Values**  
     – Selects only the data values area (no headers) for number formatting.  
   • Shortcut: PivotTable Analyze → Select → (Choose option)

6. Move PivotTable  
   • Opens the “Move PivotTable” dialog:  
     – Choose a new location (new worksheet or specific cell in an existing sheet).  
   • Useful to reorganize dashboards without rebuilding the Pivot.

7. Practical Tips  
   • Hide the Field List when you’re done designing to maximize screen space.  
   • Use Expand/Collapse to present multiple summary levels without manual grouping.  
   • Clear filters quickly to restore full data view before a new analysis.  
   • Select Labels or Values to apply distinct formatting (e.g., bold headers vs. number formats).  
   • Move your PivotTable to a fresh sheet when embedding into a report layout.

PivotChart Tools

1. Inserting a PivotChart  
   • Select any cell in your PivotTable or source range.  
   • Ribbon: PivotTable Analyze → PivotChart → choose chart type (Column, Line, Pie, etc.).  
   • Or Insert → PivotChart if starting from raw data (automatically creates linked PivotTable).

2. PivotChart Fields Pane  
   • Appears alongside your chart, mirroring the PivotTable Field List.  
   • Drag fields into:  
     – **Axis (Categories):** defines the X‑axis groupings (e.g. Month, Region).  
     – **Legend (Series):** splits data series (e.g. Product, Salesman).  
     – **Values:** numeric data to plot (e.g. Sum of Sales, Count of Orders).  
     – **Filters:** report‑level filters that apply to both chart and table.

3. Dynamic Interaction  
   • **Filtering:** click a chart element (bar, slice) → context menu → Filter → Hide Selected/Show Only Selected.  
   • **Drill‑down:** double‑click a data point to drill into underlying Pivot levels (if enabled).  
   • **Slicers & Timelines:** insert to control both PivotTable and PivotChart simultaneously.

4. Chart Tools Context Tabs  
   When the PivotChart is selected, two new ribbon tabs appear:  
   • **Chart Design:**  
     – Change Chart Type → switch to a different visualization.  
     – Switch Row/Column → swap series and category axes.  
     – Select Data → adjust source fields without altering the PivotTable.  
     – Quick Layout & Styles → apply built‑in layouts and color schemes.  
   • **Format:**  
     – Shape Styles → customize chart area, plot area, and series formatting.  
     – WordArt Styles & Text Fill → format titles and data labels.  
     – Arrange → control layering, alignment, and grouping of chart elements.

5. Synchronization with PivotTable  
   • Any change in the PivotTable (filters, grouping, sorting) immediately updates the PivotChart.  
   • Refreshing the PivotTable also refreshes the chart data.

6. Customizing Data Series  
   • Right‑click a series → Format Data Series →:  
     – Change series chart type (e.g. mix column & line).  
     – Adjust gap width, overlap, or plot on secondary axis.  
   • Add Data Labels → show values, percentages, or custom text on each data point.

7. Axis & Legend Configuration  
   • Axis Titles & Chart Title → add or edit text for clarity.  
   • Legend Position → move to top, bottom, left, right, or hide entirely.  
   • Axis Options → scale (min/max), tick marks, label position, number format.

8. Practical Tips  
   • Use **Combo Charts** (e.g. column + line) to compare different metrics.  
   • Leverage **Secondary Axis** for series with different scales.  
   • Apply **Slicers** for intuitive, clickable filtering of chart data.  
   • Consistently format PivotCharts in dashboards for a unified look.  
   • Remember: resizing or moving the PivotTable may reposition the linked PivotChart.
