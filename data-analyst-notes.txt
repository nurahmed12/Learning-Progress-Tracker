Select a cell and press Del from keyboard to delete that cell element
Choosing Borders for a group of cells
When a cell contains number and it is resized to small, the number will be shown as Complex Number
Home -> Font -> Strikethrough then the text or number of the selected cell will be crossed in the middle
For Superscript or Subscript, select the value that will go up, then click Superscript or Superscript from Font box arrow
If dragging a cell doesn't give you a series of sequential elements, then click Fill Series
If date is not increasing like you want, try different sequence until it automatically makes the cell into date format
Use Paste Special to copy column and paste it as row
Draw Border Grid can help us easily draw a border around any range of cells

- Alignment, Wrap Text, Merge & Center:

Go to Paper Layout -> Page Setup -> Paper Size and choose appropriate paper size such as A4
Align your cell elements using the Home -> Alignment and choosing either of the given alignment
From Home, click the Orientation right above the Alignment and choose alignments such as Angle Clockwise or Angle Counterclockwise
On the left side of the Orientation, the Indents can be found. We can use it to move the elements inside the cell left or right little by little
On the Alignment section, we can also find the Merge & Align section, we  can use it to merge multiple cells
We can also use Increase Intends and Decrease Indent on merge cells, and based on the merge, they behave differently
You can also insert pictures of any size and resize into cells, you can also align pictures into anywhere inside the cell, you can even remove Background of the image 😱
If you want to keep the Cell Size and also fit texts inside the cell, then click Wrap Text in the Alignment section
You can set Margins to adjust the contents inside the page, go to Page Layout then Page Setup and adjust Margins

- Currency, Accounting, Currency VS Accounting:

From Home -> Number you can select Currency or Accounting format by changing General
By default the currency and Accounting is formatted as USD, but you can change it to other currencies
To remove the USD dollar sign, we can right click on the selected cell or cells, then go to Format Cells, and change the format to None
In Currency format, the -100 is represented as -100 but in Accounting format, -100 is represented as (100)
In Currency, 0 is represented as 0.00 and in Accounting, 0 is represented as -
We can also change Currency symbol to other Symbols like Taka
We can also set custom symbols such as TK instead of symbol from Right Click -> Format Cells -> Custom and then type 0.00 TK or 0.00 "TK"

- Short Date, Long Date, Date, Time, Date & Time:

If we insert a date into a cell and if it is left aligned, then the date format is not correct
If the date format is showing MM/DD/YY then we can fix it by opening Control Panel and then clicking Clock and Region then changing the format. This will automatically change the Excel date format too
Selecting one cell then clicking Ctrl + ; will automatically insert the current date in short form in the cell
In order to add time along with date in Date, we can use Ctrl + ; , Space , Ctrl + Shift + ;

- Percentage, Fraction, Scientific, Original Number:

We can change value type into Percentage in many ways such as from General, Clicking Format Cells, Clicking at the top most of a column and then Right Click then Format Cells etc
If we select Fraction type, then inserting any decimal value will automatically convert into Fraction
If more than one values of fraction (233/523) is not shown, then we can go to Format Cells and then select Up To Three Digits

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Highlight Cells Rules):

Select cells and press Conditional Formatting then Highlight Cells Rules and then choosing any of the operations and then set a value or select a cell containing value to show insights
To change the color of a condition, go to Select Color and then Custom then Fill
We can access More rules like Greater Than or Equals To from Conditional Formatting -> Highlight Cells -> More Rules
Blanks mean if there is any missing values or not

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Top and Botton Rules):

Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow from one cell will automatically select an entire column
We can easily sort an entire column using the Sort & Filter in Home menu on the right side of Auto Sum

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Data Bars & Color Scales):

In order to insert an entire row or rows, we have to click the most left row number, then right click and insert. We can pull the black dot to select more rows, and then inserting will add more rows as well. Same goes for column
We can use Data Bars to represent sum or other calculated values in a bar form, We can remove digits and only show bars, in order to do it we need to select the bars area then go to Conditional Formatting -> More Rules -> Edit Rules -> Only Bars
Different Color Scales represent different values, you can either choose red to indicate extreme value and green as normal value, or you can do the opposite
We can go to Conditional Formatting -> Manage Rules and modify rules as needed
We can also Change the range for which the color will change, for that we need to change the Type from Manage Rules -> Edit Rules into Number, then we can set values
We can do the same for Percent
We can also use Formula like =average(A1:A9)
Percent means “out of 100.”
→ Example: 75% = 75 out of 100.
Percentile tells you the position in a dataset.
→ Example: 75th percentile = you scored better than 75% of the group.
Percent = value
Percentile = rank

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Icon Sets, and New Rules):

Double cliking selected cells' + icon will automatically copy an entire column instead of just seleting an entire column manually by dragging the + icon to the bottom or top
We can select multiple rows or columns by pressing Ctrl + left click
We can change values for which the icons will be shown from Conditional Formatting -> Manage Rules -> Edit Rules and then changing Percent to Number, we can also change condition from <= to <
Select and entire table, then go to Conditional Formatting -> New Rule then press -> Use formula to determine which cell to format ten press = and select a cell that you want to use to find all information about that cells' row, then It would show something like this =$E$9, remove $ from 9 so that the column is locked but all rows are unlocked ($ unlocks rows or columns), after that click = and click a cell outside of the table, then click format and fill a color, after that if you type any item (of the column that you used to find its' row information) in that cell outside of the table it will color the row corrosponding to that value
We can also make a rule so that whenever any text value is inserted into a cell where a number should have been placed, then the cell or eells will change color, for that we need to select a cell and go to New Rule -> Use formula to determine which cell to format then click = and type istext() and select any cell that you want to check whther it is text or not and remove the $ from both row and column and then Fill with appropriate color, after applying that use format printer to apply same rules to other cells that you want this rule to be applied on, then if any of the selected cell has text then the color of that cel will change
We can type =istext() or =isnmber() and then click a cell to show TRUE or FAlSE in any other cell

- Styles Group (Format as Table):

Clicking the bottom right most cell of a table and ten pressing Tab from keyboard will automatically insert a row at the bottom
In order to get sum value of all rows in the last column, we have to select the last column, and then press Alt + = and the column will turn into Sum or Total Column
We can access many functionalities such as Filter from each column header down arrow
We can use Select All from filter to show everything and unckeck parts that we don't want to see
Ctrl + T will automatically convert the selected area as table

- Styles Group (Cells Styles):

We can modify a Cell Style by right cliking on the style and then click on Modify
In order to get commas within big numbers, we can select cells and then go to Cell Styles and click Commas right below the Number section
Comma[0] means there will be no decimal values
We can make a custom style by clicking New Cell Style -> Format -> Custom then choosing #,##0 and typing #,##0 "/-" then ok, after that Style 2 will be created, we can choose style 2 to see the results
Merge Styles is used to bring one worksheet styles into another

- Cells Group (Format Option):

You can manually Fit Columns or Rows according to their elements by selecting the area, then Cells -> Format -> AutoFit Row Hight or AutoFit Column Width
Or you can use shortcut such as Ctrl + A to select everything, then Alt + H O A for Row Hight, and Alt + H O I for Column Width
Or we can set size of rows hight and column width by clicking Cells -> Format -> Row Hight or Column Width
We can also Hide, Unhide Columns or Rows
We can select a a specific area of a sheet by clicking one Cell of that area and then Ctrl + A, This will only select the area instead of the entire sheet
We can rename sheets and change their order
Locked cells prevent editing when the sheet is protected.
Cells are locked by default so you can choose what to protect when applying Sheet Protection.
Lock only works after enabling Review > Protect Sheet or Cells > Format > Protect Sheet
Built a project using if and Lock feature

- Formulas & Functions (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, MAX, ROUND, and More Functions):

We can find sum multiple ways like selecting an area will show sum at the bottom most of the sheet, Another way is using AutoSum, then we can also use formula such as =SUM(E8:f4)
We can swap Columns or Rows by pressing Ctrl + X on the selected Row or Column, then click on the first cell of the place where you want to place the current Row or Column and then press Ctrl + Shift + =
ROUND(Cell or Value, number of digits) 
ROUND(E11, 0) Means non decimal round, Rounds to the nearest whole number, e.g., 10.3 > 10 and 10.7 > 11, if 10.5 > 11
ROUND(E11, 1 or any positive number) Means decimal round, Rounds the (1 or any positive number)th value to it's nearest whole number, e.g., ROUND(7.445, 1) > 7.4, ROUND(7.445) > 7.45
ROUND(E11, -1 or any negative number) Means tens, hundreds or more round, Rounds the (1 or any negative number) + 1th number from right most to it's nearest whole number based on the (1 or any negative number)th number, e.g., ROUND(123412, -1) > 123410, ROUND(123416, -1) > 123420, ROUND(123415, -2) > 123400
ROUNDUP(E11, 0 or Positive or Negative) Similar to ROUND() function but it only rounds to the next whole number, e.g., ROUNDUP(5.1, 0) > 6
ROUNDDOWN(E11, 0 or Positive or Negative) Opposite of ROUNDUP()
MROUND(E11, multiple) Rounds to the nearest Multiple, e.g., MROUND(12311, 4) > 12312 Means 12312 is the nearest to 12311 which can be devided by 4

- Fill Option (Up, Down, Left, Right, Across Worksheet):

Fill option has multiple elements such as Up, Down, Left Right (Ctrl + U or D or L or R), we use it to copy and paste a cell content to the selected area of cells
We can alternatively use the Auto Fill Options icon that appears after we select a series of cells, we can change it to Copy Cells
In order to access Across Worksheets, we need to select an area then while holding Ctrl we need to click the Sheet we want to use as destinition, then the Across Worksheet will be active, then we need to click Across Worksheet and we will find options such as All, Contents, Format, we can choose either of them to copy paste items across worksheets

If you have one cell containing a number and you want to create a series then choose an area Rowwise or Columnwise then go to Fill > Series then choose either Rows or Columns based on your need and then set a number range if desired and press ok
Alternatively you can use shortcut Alt + E + I + S then Enter
If you want to move a column or row to another place without using copy paste, then Select the Column or Row, then Hover the mouse until a Move icon shows up, then Click while Holding Shift and move it to whereever needed
Linear increases additionally, Growth increases multiplically, WorkDay means all the Working Days excluding the Off Days, 
Normal Fill = repeats or continues a simple pattern
Trend Fill = fits a mathematical trend line (more intelligent)
When we have a big sentence that does not fit into a cell by default then we can use Justify to break that sentence into words and insert those words below cells one by one, It will break the sentence based on the Cell size

- Clear Option (Clear All, Clear Formats, Clear Contents, Clear Comments):

We can add comments on cells by right clicking on a cell and pressing Insert Comment
We can also reshape the Comment Box, Hide, Unhide it
Clear Formats/Contents/Comments/Hyperlinks removes specific part of the selected area but Clear All removes everything
