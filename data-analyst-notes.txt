Minimize and Maximize Formula Bar
Hiding and Unhiding Heading, Formula Bar, Gridlines from View Menu
Name box, where cell number is shown
Calculating manually by placing = and then clicking which cells are we trying to add, subtract, multiply, divide. e.g., =B2*C2
How to pull cells to automatically calculate rest of the values after calculating one
We can also perform Boolean operations or comparisons. e.g., =B2=B3 FALSE, =B2<B3 TRUE
Selecting the entire sheet by clicking the arrow at the top left corner of the sheet
Ctrl + Navigation button (up, left, bottom, right) takes us to the end of the sheet
Centering values in the cell through Home -> Alignment 
Vertical and Horizontal Scroll
Create multiple Sheets and navigating to them
Zoom in Zoom out, Font Size, Style etc etc
Status bar (Bottom left) shows Ready (ready to work), Enter (pressing enter will complete)

Creating new files, Saving files, Opening files manually and with Keyboard Shortcut (Ctrl + N, Ctrl + S, Ctrl + O)
Print the excel file

- Introduction (Cut, Copy, Paste, Format Painter, Clear All):

Copy, Cut, Paste using buttons from Home and using shortcuts (Ctrl + x | c | v)
After changing font or style or color of a cell element, we can select that cell and click Format Printer and then drag other cells to apply same font or style or color to them as well
When we copy or cut something then the Clipboard contains that value, we can simply take it use it later, we can click Paste All to paste all Clipboard elements at once

- Basic Navigation: 
Ribbons (The navigations on the top, can be hidden using Ctrl + F1)
Cells (Where we insert data)
Range (Selected cells area. e.g., A1:D1 (Horizontal), A1:A5 (Vertical), A1:D5 (Multiple selection))
Worksheets (Tabs of sheets of excel. e.g., | Sheet1 | Sheet2 | )

- Font Group (All Options):

Double clicking a column edge will automatically adjust it's size to show full texts, based on the elements it contains
Font size increase and decrease
Different Fonts and styles (Ctrl + B makes texts bold, same goes to Ctrl + U | I)
Click arrow beside Underline to choose Double Underline
Font and Cell Color change
Phone number's first 0 is not shown, so we start with ' and then type number to show the leading 0, but it will be considered String
Select a cell and press Del from keyboard to delete that cell element
Choosing Borders for a group of cells
When a cell contains number and it is resized to small, the number will be shown as Complex Number
Home -> Font -> Strikethrough then the text or number of the selected cell will be crossed in the middle
For Superscript or Subscript, select the value that will go up, then click Superscript or Superscript from Font box arrow
If dragging a cell doesn't give you a series of sequential elements, then click Fill Series
If date is not increasing like you want, try different sequence until it automatically makes the cell into date format
Use Paste Special to copy column and paste it as row
Draw Border Grid can help us easily draw a border around any range of cells

- Alignment, Wrap Text, Merge & Center:

Go to Paper Layout -> Page Setup -> Paper Size and choose appropriate paper size such as A4
Align your cell elements using the Home -> Alignment and choosing either of the given alignment
From Home, click the Orientation right above the Alignment and choose alignments such as Angle Clockwise or Angle Counterclockwise
On the left side of the Orientation, the Indents can be found. We can use it to move the elements inside the cell left or right little by little
On the Alignment section, we can also find the Merge & Align section, we  can use it to merge multiple cells
We can also use Increase Intends and Decrease Indent on merge cells, and based on the merge, they behave differently
You can also insert pictures of any size and resize into cells, you can also align pictures into anywhere inside the cell, you can even remove Background of the image 😱
If you want to keep the Cell Size and also fit texts inside the cell, then click Wrap Text in the Alignment section
You can set Margins to adjust the contents inside the page, go to Page Layout then Page Setup and adjust Margins

- Currency, Accounting, Currency VS Accounting:

From Home -> Number you can select Currency or Accounting format by changing General
By default the currency and Accounting is formatted as USD, but you can change it to other currencies
To remove the USD dollar sign, we can right click on the selected cell or cells, then go to Format Cells, and change the format to None
In Currency format, the -100 is represented as -100 but in Accounting format, -100 is represented as (100)
In Currency, 0 is represented as 0.00 and in Accounting, 0 is represented as -
We can also change Currency symbol to other Symbols like Taka
We can also set custom symbols such as TK instead of symbol from Right Click -> Format Cells -> Custom and then type 0.00 TK or 0.00 "TK"

- Short Date, Long Date, Date, Time, Date & Time:

If we insert a date into a cell and if it is left aligned, then the date format is not correct
If the date format is showing MM/DD/YY then we can fix it by opening Control Panel and then clicking Clock and Region then changing the format. This will automatically change the Excel date format too
Selecting one cell then clicking Ctrl + ; will automatically insert the current date in short form in the cell
In order to add time along with date in Date, we can use Ctrl + ; , Space , Ctrl + Shift + ;

- Percentage, Fraction, Scientific, Original Number:

We can change value type into Percentage in many ways such as from General, Clicking Format Cells, Clicking at the top most of a column and then Right Click then Format Cells etc
If we select Fraction type, then inserting any decimal value will automatically convert into Fraction
If more than one values of fraction (233/523) is not shown, then we can go to Format Cells and then select Up To Three Digits

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Highlight Cells Rules):

Select cells and press Conditional Formatting then Highlight Cells Rules and then choosing any of the operations and then set a value or select a cell containing value to show insights
To change the color of a condition, go to Select Color and then Custom then Fill
We can access More rules like Greater Than or Equals To from Conditional Formatting -> Highlight Cells -> More Rules
Blanks mean if there is any missing values or not

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Top and Botton Rules):

Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow from one cell will automatically select an entire column
We can easily sort an entire column using the Sort & Filter in Home menu on the right side of Auto Sum

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Data Bars & Color Scales):

In order to insert an entire row or rows, we have to click the most left row number, then right click and insert. We can pull the black dot to select more rows, and then inserting will add more rows as well. Same goes for column
We can use Data Bars to represent sum or other calculated values in a bar form, We can remove digits and only show bars, in order to do it we need to select the bars area then go to Conditional Formatting -> More Rules -> Edit Rules -> Only Bars
Different Color Scales represent different values, you can either choose red to indicate extreme value and green as normal value, or you can do the opposite
We can go to Conditional Formatting -> Manage Rules and modify rules as needed
We can also Change the range for which the color will change, for that we need to change the Type from Manage Rules -> Edit Rules into Number, then we can set values
We can do the same for Percent
We can also use Formula like =average(A1:A9)
Percent means “out of 100.”
→ Example: 75% = 75 out of 100.
Percentile tells you the position in a dataset.
→ Example: 75th percentile = you scored better than 75% of the group.
Percent = value
Percentile = rank

- Styles Group Conditional Formatting (Icon Sets, and New Rules):

Double cliking selected cells' + icon will automatically copy an entire column instead of just seleting an entire column manually by dragging the + icon to the bottom or top
We can select multiple rows or columns by pressing Ctrl + left click
We can change values for which the icons will be shown from Conditional Formatting -> Manage Rules -> Edit Rules and then changing Percent to Number, we can also change condition from <= to <
Select and entire table, then go to Conditional Formatting -> New Rule then press -> Use formula to determine which cell to format ten press = and select a cell that you want to use to find all information about that cells' row, then It would show something like this =$E$9, remove $ from 9 so that the column is locked but all rows are unlocked ($ unlocks rows or columns), after that click = and click a cell outside of the table, then click format and fill a color, after that if you type any item (of the column that you used to find its' row information) in that cell outside of the table it will color the row corrosponding to that value
We can also make a rule so that whenever any text value is inserted into a cell where a number should have been placed, then the cell or eells will change color, for that we need to select a cell and go to New Rule -> Use formula to determine which cell to format then click = and type istext() and select any cell that you want to check whther it is text or not and remove the $ from both row and column and then Fill with appropriate color, after applying that use format printer to apply same rules to other cells that you want this rule to be applied on, then if any of the selected cell has text then the color of that cel will change
We can type =istext() or =isnmber() and then click a cell to show TRUE or FAlSE in any other cell

- Styles Group (Format as Table):

Clicking the bottom right most cell of a table and ten pressing Tab from keyboard will automatically insert a row at the bottom
In order to get sum value of all rows in the last column, we have to select the last column, and then press Alt + = and the column will turn into Sum or Total Column
We can access many functionalities such as Filter from each column header down arrow
We can use Select All from filter to show everything and unckeck parts that we don't want to see
Ctrl + T will automatically convert the selected area as table

- Styles Group (Cells Styles):

We can modify a Cell Style by right cliking on the style and then click on Modify
In order to get commas within big numbers, we can select cells and then go to Cell Styles and click Commas right below the Number section
Comma[0] means there will be no decimal values
We can make a custom style by clicking New Cell Style -> Format -> Custom then choosing #,##0 and typing #,##0 "/-" then ok, after that Style 2 will be created, we can choose style 2 to see the results
Merge Styles is used to bring one worksheet styles into another

- Cells Group (Insert and Delete):
 
Insert Sheet Rows/Columns will add an entire row or column
Insert Sheet is used to add Sheets and same goes for the Delete Sheet

- Cells Group (Format Option):

You can manually Fit Columns or Rows according to their elements by selecting the area, then Cells -> Format -> AutoFit Row Hight or AutoFit Column Width
Or you can use shortcut such as Ctrl + A to select everything, then Alt + H O A for Row Hight, and Alt + H O I for Column Width
Or we can set size of rows hight and column width by clicking Cells -> Format -> Row Hight or Column Width
We can also Hide, Unhide Columns or Rows
We can select a a specific area of a sheet by clicking one Cell of that area and then Ctrl + A, This will only select the area instead of the entire sheet
We can rename sheets and change their order
Locked cells prevent editing when the sheet is protected.
Cells are locked by default so you can choose what to protect when applying Sheet Protection.
Lock only works after enabling Review > Protect Sheet or Cells > Format > Protect Sheet
Built a project using if and Lock feature

- Formulas & Functions (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, MAX, ROUND, and More Functions):

We can find sum multiple ways like selecting an area will show sum at the bottom most of the sheet, Another way is using AutoSum, then we can also use formula such as =SUM(E8:f4)
We can swap Columns or Rows by pressing Ctrl + X on the selected Row or Column, then click on the first cell of the place where you want to place the current Row or Column and then press Ctrl + Shift + =
ROUND(Cell or Value, number of digits) 
ROUND(E11, 0) Means non decimal round, Rounds to the nearest whole number, e.g., 10.3 > 10 and 10.7 > 11, if 10.5 > 11
ROUND(E11, 1 or any positive number) Means decimal round, Rounds the (1 or any positive number)th value to it's nearest whole number, e.g., ROUND(7.445, 1) > 7.4, ROUND(7.445) > 7.45
ROUND(E11, -1 or any negative number) Means tens, hundreds or more round, Rounds the (1 or any negative number) + 1th number from right most to it's nearest whole number based on the (1 or any negative number)th number, e.g., ROUND(123412, -1) > 123410, ROUND(123416, -1) > 123420, ROUND(123415, -2) > 123400
ROUNDUP(E11, 0 or Positive or Negative) Similar to ROUND() function but it only rounds to the next whole number, e.g., ROUNDUP(5.1, 0) > 6
ROUNDDOWN(E11, 0 or Positive or Negative) Opposite of ROUNDUP()
MROUND(E11, multiple) Rounds to the nearest Multiple, e.g., MROUND(12311, 4) > 12312 Means 12312 is the nearest to 12311 which can be devided by 4

- Fill Option (Up, Down, Left, Right, Across Worksheet):

Fill option has multiple elements such as Up, Down, Left Right (Ctrl + U or D or L or R), we use it to copy and paste a cell content to the selected area of cells
We can alternatively use the Auto Fill Options icon that appears after we select a series of cells, we can change it to Copy Cells
In order to access Across Worksheets, we need to select an area then while holding Ctrl we need to click the Sheet we want to use as destinition, then the Across Worksheet will be active, then we need to click Across Worksheet and we will find options such as All, Contents, Format, we can choose either of them to copy paste items across worksheets

- Fill Option (Fill Series and Justify):

If you have one cell containing a number and you want to create a series then choose an area Rowwise or Columnwise then go to Fill > Series then choose either Rows or Columns based on your need and then set a number range if desired and press ok
Alternatively you can use shortcut Alt + E + I + S then Enter
If you want to move a column or row to another place without using copy paste, then Select the Column or Row, then Hover the mouse until a Move icon shows up, then Click while Holding Shift and move it to whereever needed
Linear increases additionally, Growth increases multiplically, WorkDay means all the Working Days excluding the Off Days, 
Normal Fill = repeats or continues a simple pattern
Trend Fill = fits a mathematical trend line (more intelligent)
When we have a big sentence that does not fit into a cell by default then we can use Justify to break that sentence into words and insert those words below cells one by one, It will break the sentence based on the Cell size

- Clear Option (Clear All, Clear Formats, Clear Contents, Clear Comments):

We can add comments on cells by right clicking on a cell and pressing Insert Comment
We can also reshape the Comment Box, Hide, Unhide it
Clear Formats/Contents/Comments/Hyperlinks removes specific part of the selected area but Clear All removes everything
Clear Hyperlinks removes only hyperlinks while Remove Hyperlinks removes both hyperlinks and formatting (underline, blue color)

- Editing Group (Sorting):

In order to generate random series you can use the formula =ROUND(Value1, (Value2 - Value1) * RAND(), 2) , this will generate random numbers between Value1 and Value2
1. RAND()
Returns a random decimal number between 0 and 1.
Example output: 0.2438, 0.8793, etc.
2. (b - a)
This is the range or width of the interval.
For example, if a = 5 and b = 10, then (b - a) = 5.
3. (b - a) * RAND()
Scales the random number into your desired range.
Now you get a random decimal between 0 and (b - a).
Example: If RAND() = 0.3, and (b - a) = 5, then this part is 1.5.
4. a + ...
This shifts the number up to start at a.
So you now get a number between a and b.
Example: a = 5, so 5 + 1.5 = 6.5
5. ROUND(..., 2)
Rounds the final result to 2 decimal places.
We can also use =RANDBETWEEN(Value1, Value2), it will generate random numbers between Value1 and Value2
We can also sort color wise, for that, go to Sort & Filter > Custom Sort and select Sort on to Color, then we can choose Order color and Ascending or Descending, after that we can Add Level and order the color based on our need
We can use the Up and Down buttons to move a selected Cell upward or downward
We can also do the same for Cell Icons
We can customize the order by selecting Custom List and listing the values as we desire
We can also save the custom order by clicking the Add button
We can sort multiple columns by selecting them and then choosing Custom sort and adding levels for each column
If we select an area where a blank cell exists, then sorting will place that blank cell at the most bottom
We can select a single cell of a column and click sort and the entire column will be sorted
If we want to sort a single column of an area where all the columns are connected, then an warning messege will pop and give us two options, where if we choose Expand the selection then the entire area will change with the sort, but If we choose Continue with current selection then the connection will not be represented properly
Selecting an entire area and then custom sorting only one column will change others accordingly

- Editing Group (Custom Sort):

If our columns are not placed sequentially like Name ID Income Age, then we can custom sort it and fix their positions, in order to do that we need to mark 1 to n (number of columns) to each column based on which position what column should be in ascending order, we should mark each cell by placing 1 to n on their immidiate above cell, then we should select the area with those marked cells above, after that we click Custom sort > Options > Sort left to right, and then we should select Sort by as the initial row number
We can do the same thing for Top to bottom

- Editing Group (Filter):

Ctrl + Shift + L turn Auto Filters to selected area, you may see dropdown icon appear, but that does not mean that the area is converted into a table, it shows up because of AutoFilters, in order to convert a selected area into table, use Ctrl + T
AND = Both condition must be true
OR = Either one can be true or both
Once we apply filter to a selected area and then make any change in any cell or rows of the selected cell, then the Reapply option becomes accessible, by clicking Reapply button, we can reapply all the filters to the changed cells or rows and the cells or rows of the selected area will change 

- Editing Group (Find & Replace):

Ctrl + F is the shortcut for Find and Replace
From Options << we can find Match case, which will only show targets that matches exactly, and becomes case sensitive
Match entire cell contents will only show targets that matches only search portion, cells containing additional contents will not be shown, it is not case sensitive
If we select Within Workbook, then all targets accross all sheets will be shown
By rows mean the search will show next results row by row if the target is present in the same row, and then to the next column
By columns mean the opposite
If we select Lock in as Comments, and write something for example Good Boy in the Find what box, then the result will show all comments containing Good Boy
Ctrl + H will redirect you to the Find and Replace > Replace 
If we want to replace formats accross cells then, click Format box of Find what and select Choose format from cells and click which cell you want as target, then click the Format box of Replace with, then you can either manually select a format or you can Choose format from other cells

- Editing Group (Find & Select (Go to & Go to Special)):

Ctrl + G is the shortcut for Go To section
Fn + F5 is an alternative shortcut
Go to is used to go to any specific cell
Constants mean cells that does not have any formula, or general data
=CONCATENATE(E11, " ", D11) is used to concatenate two strings and create a new strings, in this case cell E11 and D11 are combined with a space " " to create a new string
Current region will select an area if the current selected cell belongs to one area, if not, then only the cell will be shown
Array is used to perform calculations with multiple cells at once, in traditional ways we apply a formula and drag down the formula to generate other results with same formula, but in array, when we apply a formula, it automatically applies the formula to other selected cells as well
regular formulas as scalar operations: they take one (or a few) inputs and give you one output in a single cell. An array formula lets you work with whole sets of inputs at once, and — depending on the function — can return multiple outputs (spill into many cells) or feed a multi‑step calculation in one shot.
In order to use array, we must use Ctrl + Shift + Enter in a cell to activate array to that cell
e.g., We cannot do this normally =AVERAGE(C30:C45 - D30:D45), but by clicking Ctrl + Shift + Enter we can make it array and do this task
WordArt, images, shapes, emojis are Objects
Row difference and Column difference show non similar or unequal values within an area row by row or column by column
Precedents and Dependents are like Independent and Dependent variables, Independents are those which leads to a calculation of other value, while dependents are the result that is derived from independents
Ctrl + [ is the shortcut to find Precedent
We can show tracking of Precedents by clicking Formulas > Trace precedents, then an arrow will show navigation fo how the precedents leads to a result
Ctrl + ] is the shortcut for showing dependents
Precedent -> What cells affect the value of the current or selected cell
Dependent -> What cells are affected by the value of the current or selected cell
If we select an entire column by clicking at the top and then press Ctrl + Shift + -> or <- then all of the cells including the selected column's cells will be selected in arrow's direction, then we can fill them with white color to make the cells disappear
We can do the same with row by selecting a row as well
Ctrl + end will take you to the last cell 
Ctrl + home will take you to the first cell 
If we hide some rows or columns and then copy the area and paste it in other sheets or files, then the hidden cells will also be pasted, in order to prevent that after we hide some cells or rows or columns, then we select the area and Go to special > Visible cells only then copy the area and paste it somewhere else, then the hidden cells will not be pasted
We can use the shortcut Alt + ; to select Visible cells only
Conditional formatting shows us where in the entire file Conditional formatting is applied

- Data Validation (Any value and Whole number):

If we choose a data validation from Data > Data Validation which is in the Data Tools section, then change Allow from Any value to other such as Whole number then the selected cells will only allow you to fill whole numbers only, if you try anything else, it will show an error
We can also custom set an input message from Data > Data Validation > Input Message to show when the user is entering an input
The input message pop up box can be dragged to some other place if bothering
We can also select the Error Alert from Data > Data Validation > Style as Stop (Does not allow the user to continue), Warning (The user is shown a warning message but still can continue), Information (Similar to warning message)
If we choose either Information or Warning and enter an invalid data then we can spot them by clicking Data Validation > Circle Invalid Data and all the invalid data will be circled
We can clear the circles by clicking Data Validation > Clear Validation Circles
After writing something in a cell and presseing Enter will move to the bottom cell, but pressing Shift + Enter will move to the above cell
Instead of manually typing values in cells, we can use Dropdown list that adds a dropdown arrow attached to cells from which we can select pre defined values
In order to do that we need to select the area then Data Validation, then select List in Allow section, and type which options or values you want to show in the list in source section
We can also do another thing, we can list whichever contents that we want to use in the list in somewhere in the sheet, and instead of typing the options or values in the Source section we can select those cells where the elements are 
If you add a new option or value in that reference list, then the value will not be shown in the dropdown, so you have to move the new option or value using Shift + Drag to the middle of that list
We can also change order by moving or replacing cells within the reference list
We can also use reference list from other sheets as well
Text length means what will be the length of the text that we will put in every cell, suppose we write Hello in a cell, so if we set the text length to 5 then it will allow hello to be inserted, but if we add one more letter then it will show error, Note that space is also counted as letter
For allowing only unique values remember this:
1. Formula Pattern
   =COUNTIF(<lookup_range>, <this_cell>) = 1
   • Returns TRUE if the value in <this_cell> appears exactly once in <lookup_range>.

2. Locking the Lookup Range
   • Fixed block (e.g. rows 10–17 in column K):
     =COUNTIF($K$10:$K$17, K10)=1
     – $K$10:$K$17 stays the same when you copy down.
     – K10 (no $) changes to K11, K12, etc.

   • Entire column:
     =COUNTIF($K:$K, K10)=1
     – $K:$K always means the whole column K.
     – Good for growing lists; slower on very large sheets; counts blanks too.

3. Criterion Cell Reference
   • Relative row (K10): adjusts to each row.
   • Absolute row ($K$10): always tests cell K10.

4. “$” Cheat‑Sheet
   • $ before column (e.g. $K) locks column.
   • $ before row (e.g. K$10) locks row.
   • $K$10 locks both column and row (single cell).
   • $K:$K locks entire column K.
   • $K$10:$K$17 locks that exact block.

CountIF function:

Quick Guide to COUNTIF in Excel

1. Function Structure  
   COUNTIF(range, criteria)  
   • Counts how many cells in range meet the given criteria.

2. Parameters  
   • range: the block of cells to check (e.g. A1:A100, K:K)  
   • criteria: condition each cell is tested against (number, expression, text, wildcard, or cell reference)

3. Types of Criteria  
   • Number  
     – COUNTIF(A1:A10, 5)  
       Counts cells exactly equal to 5.  
   • Expression (comparison)  
     – COUNTIF(B1:B20, “>100”)  
       Counts cells with values greater than 100.  
     – Operators: =, <>, >, <, >=, <= (always in quotes)  
   • Text  
     – COUNTIF(C1:C50, “Apple”)  
       Counts cells exactly matching “Apple” (case‑insensitive).  
   • Wildcards  
     – `*` matches any sequence of characters  
       • COUNTIF(NameRange, "East*") finds “East”, “Eastern Campus”, etc.  
       • COUNTIF(NameRange, "*son") finds “Johnson”, “Anderson”, etc.  
     – `?` matches exactly one character  
       • COUNTIF(CodeRange, "A?3") finds “AB3”, “A63” but not “A123”.  
       • COUNTIF(WordRange, "?at") finds “Cat”, “Bat” but not “That”.  
   • Cell reference  
     – COUNTIF(F1:F50, G1)  
       Counts cells equal to the value in G1.  
   • Expression with reference  
     – COUNTIF(F1:F50, “>” & G1)  
       Counts cells greater than the value in G1.  
   • Dates  
     – COUNTIF(H1:H100, “>” & DATE(2025,1,1))  
       Counts dates after Jan 1, 2025.  
     – Can also reference a cell: “>” & A1 where A1 holds a date.

4. Special Behaviors  
   • Blanks vs. non‑blanks  
     – COUNTIF(A1:A10, “”) counts empty cells.  
     – COUNTIF(A1:A10, “<>”) counts cells that are not empty.  
   • Mixed data types  
     – Numbers in quotes (e.g. “5”) are treated as text, not numeric.  
   • Logical values and errors  
     – COUNTIF will ignore TRUE, FALSE, and error values unless they match the criteria exactly.  
   • Whole‑column ranges (e.g. K:K)  
     – Scans all 1,048,576 rows; includes blank cells in the count.  
     – Use with care on very large sheets (performance).

5. Common Uses  
   • Count specific status  
     – COUNTIF(StatusRange, “Completed”)  
   • Count above/below thresholds  
     – COUNTIF(ScoreRange, “>=80”)  
     – COUNTIF(ScoreRange, “<50”)  
   • Partial text matching  
     – COUNTIF(NameRange, “Mc*”) finds names starting with “Mc”.  
   • Compare to another cell  
     – COUNTIF(DateRange, “<” & DeadlineCell)  
   • Unique‑value test  
     – COUNTIF($K:$K, K10)=1 returns TRUE if K10 is unique in column K.

6. Locking References  
   • $A$1:$A$10 locks both column & row (never shifts)  
   • A$1 locks row only (column shifts when copying across)  
   • $A1 locks column only (row shifts when copying down)  
   • $K:$K locks entire column K  
   • $K$10:$K$17 locks block K10–K17  

7. Relative vs. Absolute Ranges  
   • Relative range (K10:K17) will “drift” when copied down (→ K11:K18, K12:K19, etc.)  
   • Use absolute ranges ($K$10:$K$17 or $K:$K) to keep the lookup area fixed  

8. Multiple Criteria  
   • Use COUNTIFS for AND logic:  
     COUNTIFS(Range1, Criteria1, Range2, Criteria2, …)  
   • For OR logic, combine multiple COUNTIFs or use SUMPRODUCT

9. Tips  
   • Always enclose operators (>, <, <>) in quotes and concatenate with & for cell refs.  
   • Use wildcards (*, ?) for flexible text matches.  
   • When testing uniqueness, include a non‑blank check:  
     =AND(K10<>"", COUNTIF($K:$K, K10)=1)  
   • Keep ranges tight (avoid entire columns) for better performance.  

We can use =ISODD(any cell of the selected area) to allow only odd values across the selected area
Same goes for =ISEVEN()
Similarly =ISTEXT(any cell of the selected area) can be used to only allow texts
Same goes for =ISNUMBER()

Quick Guide: Introduction to Pivot Tables in Excel

1. What Is a Pivot Table?  
   • An interactive summary tool that automatically aggregates, analyzes, and presents large data sets.  
   • Lets you “pivot” (re‑arrange) rows and columns to see different perspectives.

2. When to Use Pivot Tables  
   • You have a detailed table of records (e.g., sales transactions, survey responses).  
   • You need quick totals, averages, counts, or subgroup analyses by category.  
   • You want an easy drag‑and‑drop interface instead of complex formulas.

3. Basic Components  
   • **Rows area**: Fields you want listed down the side (e.g., Salesman, District).  
   • **Columns area**: Fields you want across the top (e.g., Month, Item).  
   • **Values area**: Numeric fields to summarize (e.g., Sales TK) — default is “Sum,” can change to “Count,” “Average,” etc.  
   • **Filters area**: Fields to filter the entire report (e.g., Year, Region).

4. Creating a Pivot Table  
   1. Select any cell in your data table.  
   2. Go to **Insert → PivotTable**.  
   3. Choose where to place it (new worksheet or existing).  
   4. Click **OK**.

5. Building the Layout  
   • Drag fields from the Field List into Rows, Columns, Values, and Filters.  
   • Rearrange fields to change the view.  
   • Right‑click a Value and choose **Value Field Settings** to switch from Sum to Count, Average, Min, Max, etc.

6. Common Analyses  
   • **Total sales by salesman**: Rows = Salesman; Values = Sum of Sales TK.  
   • **Sales by month and district**: Rows = Month; Columns = District; Values = Sum of Sales TK.  
   • **Count of transactions by item**: Rows = Item; Values = Count of Item.

7. Tips & Tricks  
   • **Refresh** after data changes: Right‑click PivotTable → Refresh.  
   • **Group dates**: Right‑click a Date/Month field → Group → choose Years, Quarters, Months.  
   • **Show % of total**: Value Field Settings → Show Values As → % of Grand Total or % of Row/Column Total.  
   • **PivotChart**: Click inside PivotTable → PivotChart for dynamic charts.  
   • **Slicers** (Excel 2010+): Insert → Slicer to add clickable filters.

8. Keep in Mind  
   • Source data should have no blank header names and no completely blank rows/columns.  
   • Use an Excel Table (Insert → Table) as your source to allow dynamic range growth.  
   • PivotTables do not automatically update when you add new columns—refresh and ensure the source range covers them.

Keep this cheat‑sheet handy next time you need to slice and dice your data in seconds!
